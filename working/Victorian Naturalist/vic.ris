N2  - This paper examines Victoria's land-use history and the range of environmental, economic and social forces that resulted in the significant depletion of the state's natural assets. Historically, a succession of differing management practices has been applied to Victoria's natural assets, from Koori husbandry, through pastoralism to the more intensive agriculture of settlers. In the 20th century agronomy and technology further intensified and industrialised production across most landscapes. Land-use activities of one generation frequently caused management issues for the following generation, continuing a decline in the living natural capital. Environmental assets and processes were not considered and remained as external factors to economic production. Analysis suggests current and future drivers of land-use are changing and thus that future landscapes will change. There are therefore opportunities for the community to reverse some of the adverse effects of past practices. This increased knowledge, plus the affluence gained through past consumption of natural assets, should be used to replenish the living natural capital.

N2  - Utility corridors such as powerlines are widespread linear easements of highly modified vegetation which often fragment natural areas of conservation significance. Vegetation management along these easements is aimed at modifying vegetation structure by the removal of all tall shrubs and trees, which may have adverse impacts on flora and fauna diversity. Victoria's Bunyip State Park is bisected by a high voltage powerline easement which is managed by a four year slashing cycle. Repeated slashing has altered plant species composition and structure of the drier slope and ridge vegetation compared to unslashed adjacent Open Forest vegetation, but Wet Heath within the management zone has remained largely unmodified. At a broad level, plant species diversity in the easement is increased, and higher vegetation density has created small mammal habitat. The powerline easement did not appear to facilitate weed invasion. Vegetation management by repeated slashing has altered the vegetation, but does not appear to have had adverse conservation impacts on local plant and small mammal diversity.

N2  - Observations of the diving behaviour of Hardhead Ayhtya australis on a sewage pond were carried out over a two-day period. The length of the recovery period between dives did not influence the duration of the following dive, and likewise, the length of the recovery period was not influenced by the duration of the preceding dive. The length of dives and recovery periods varied significantly among individuals. Other factors that may influence diving behaviour, such as water depth and temperature, warrant further investigation.

N2  - Sea level may rise in Port Phillip Bay in response to global warming and higher ocean levels, while channel deepening at the entrance will produce higher high tides. A rising sea level will lead to submergence and increased erosion on the bay shores, and the eventual disappearance of Mud Islands. The response to submergence should be landfilling to raise low lying areas, while increased coastal erosion should be countered by renourishment of protective beaches rather than the building of sea walls or boulder ramparts.

N2  - In Victoria's contemporary rural environments, introduced predators may represent the principal predatory threat to many large, non-venomous reptile species. We present circumstantial evidence that introduced canids are predators of the Inland Carpet Python Morelia spilota metcalfei, using data collected during a radio-telemetric study of the sub-species' ecology across northern Victoria. Seven pythons (23% of those tracked) were killed by predators during the study, and evidence collected during transmitter retrieval suggested that foxes or wild dogs were involved in six of these cases (the seventh having been eaten by a goanna). Evidence includes the recovery of transmitters from fox den sites, their partial burial in several cases (consistent with caching behaviour) and damage to each transmitter consistent with chewing by a fox or dog (teeth marks in the silicon coating, puncture of the metal housing). Given the abundance of canids (specifically foxes) within these study sites, their ability to prey on carpet pythons, and evidence of their involvement with these predation events, we conclude that canid predation was the primary cause of death for each of these six snakes, and represents a potentially significant issue for carpet python conservation in Victoria. Suggestions for canid control programs and habitat management to minimise this threat to remaining populations of this endangered snake are offered.

This report is a descriptive account of the vascular flora of a small but relatively high-quality site in East Burwood. Basic floristic information is recorded, along with a brief discussion of the variation in vegetation patterns in the immediate area. Such descriptive accounts may be useful in future restoration projects. Several taxa of particular note are discussed, including the locally uncommon Shiny Wallaby-grass Austrodanthonia induta, a double-flowered form of Golden Weather-glass Hypoxis hygrometrica, and several putative hybrids. A full species list is provided.

N2  - The importance of Australian estuaries is well established. However, the management of these estuaries is not receiving appropriate attention. This paper examines the management situation of estuaries in Australia through a catchment level assessment of the Barwon estuary. The study finds that there are potential gaps between the relevant management agencies. The study identifies the reasons for these gaps. The study also reveals that there are many opportunities through which estuaries could be managed very effectively. The study finally suggests the effective management approach for estuaries in Australia.

N2  - This review synthesises present knowledge of the distribution patterns and habitat requirements of the Yellow-footed Antechinus Antechinus flavipes. Factors influencing the distribution of A. flavipes are examined at several spatial scales ranging from the broad climatic conditions prevalent over the species' entire range to the characteristics of nest sites used by individual animals. Analysis of the literature suggests that: 1) at the broad-scale, A. flavipes distribution is largely determined by warm, dry climatic conditions, the distribution of dry forests and woodlands and competition with closely related species; 2) at the landscape-scale the determinants of A. flavipes distribution are largely unknown, although initial investigations suggest some tolerance of fragmented landscapes; and 3) at a local-scale the distribution of A. flavipes is largely determined by the presence of large diameter trees, tree hollows, coarse woody debris, rocky crevices and leaf-litter. Directions for future research are suggested throughout the review.

N2  - Study of Australian Tongue Orchids addresses questions of widespread interest about the evolution of sexually deceptive pollination, and provides information for conservation and management. We present recent data on flowering, pollination, and fruit set for three Cryptostylis species: the Bonnet Orchid C. erecta RBr, the Small Tongue Orchid C. leptochila F Muell. Ex Benth. and the Large Tongue Orchid C. subulata (Labill.) HG Reichb. (Jones 1988). These species are pollinated by male Orchid Dupe Wasps Lissopimpla excelsa (Ichneumonidae) when they 'pseudocopulate' with the flowers. Cryptostylis subulata flowered from December to February, and C. erecta flowered from November to March. Cryptostylis leptochila began flowering in December, and pollination was still occurring in late April. This species had the most flowers, but the lowest fruit set. In most field sites, the earliest flowers on a raceme were pollinated most often, although this did not occur when pollinators were scarce. Orchids may attract pollinators more easily at the start of the flowering season before the female wasps emerge, or pollinators could learn the locations or appearance of orchids and avoid later-opening flowers. We also found that pollinator abundance varied during and between seasons, there was no evidence of self-pollination, and C. erecta racemes were more likely to be eaten by predators after fruit set.

N2  - The development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system is the key objective of the National Reserve System, and is supported by all Australian States and Territories. In Victoria, the purchase of private land for incorporation into the parks and reserves system assists in the protection of some of the State's most endangered ecosystems. This article outlines the ecological attributes of private land purchased for addition to the Victorian public protected area system between 2004 and 2005.

N2  - Standard survey techniques were used to assess the mammalian fauna of Phillip and French Islands in Western Port, Victoria between 1997 and 2005. In total, 16 native and 7 exotic species were recorded on Phillip Island and 13 native and 8 exotic species on French Island. The most diverse faunal group was the microbats (7 species in total). Species present were compared with those previously recorded on the two islands and the adjacent mainland. Deliberate and accidental introductions since European settlement of both Australian native and non-native species have substantially changed the species present on both islands. The greatest threats to current mammalian fauna on the islands include foxes (currently not resident on French Island), land-clearance, road traffic, and irresponsible human-induced introductions.

N2  - In 1986 a small, outlying population of Leadbeater's Possum was discovered inhabiting lowland swamp forest at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Given the pronounced differences between the vegetation community at this site and that throughout the possum's stronghold in the Victorian Central Highlands, some people have speculated that the species may have been introduced to Yellingbo. I list several reasons why this is unlikely to be the case.

N2  - This study is preliminary to ongoing investigations of soil crusts and associated invertebrates in north-west Victoria, focusing on the Little Desert National Park. Ninety quadrats from nine sites were sampled. Eighteen bryophyte species (nine mosses, nine liverworts) were identified within the quadrats. All invertebrates were from the Phylum Arthropoda. Overall abundance and diversity of invertebrates was low. While sampling in the drier months is valuable for observing the dynamics of soil crusts in this region, a more comprehensive assessment of species diversity is gained by sampling during wetter periods.

Nine sites were placed in sheltered gullies and ten sites were placed in upslope stands. Fifty-one tracheophyte taxa, 49 moss taxa and 39 liverwort (including hornwort) taxa were recorded in total. Bryophyte species richness was significantly higher in gully sites. The most frequent bryophyte taxa varied between gully and upslope sites. The percentage occurrence of certain substrates was shown to be an important determinant of bryophyte species richness and composition. Decaying wood and soil supported the greatest number of bryophyte taxa compared with all other substrates.

Within both populations perichaetia were observed more frequently than perigonia, although the number of antheridia was greater than the number of archegonia. A clear seasonality in the sequence and timing of sexual reproduction occurred, with little variation due to habitat. Antheridia began development in spring, after sporophytes had reached maturity. Initiation of archegonial development occurred approximately one month later. Spores were isosporic and 3 &#956;m in diameter. Release of mature spores peaked in spring. The sporophyte maturation cycle of A. androgynum was 12 months.

N2  - Colonial and post-colonial views of 'europeanising' the landscape have evolved to a new sense of place which embraces native biodiversity. Victoria's economy has diversified and new drivers of change in land use, not based on the primacy of intensive agricultural production, are apparent across large areas of Victoria. Past science and technology (agronomy and engineering) is being challenged by emerging sciences, and new concepts such as ecosystem services can be combined to replenish the natural capital. The inevitability of global warming and the necessity to maximise the capacity of our biodiversity to adapt will be important drivers. Replenishment will happen through changing community values; the availability of adequate space and habitat; and the increase in pertinent and applied knowledge.

N2  - An understanding of the ecology of the Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp was obtained from historical surveys and soil maps. The probable boundary of the former largest swamp in Victoria was determined. The immense swamp had distinct zones formed by inner and outer swamps: the inner swamp was a permanently inundated reed and rush swamp with emergent sand ridges and possibly with lake-like cells, while the fringing outer swamp was largely paperbark scrub subject to frequent flooding. Grassland and acacia woodland were locally extensive adjacent to the swamp in areas of periodic flooding. The inner swamp boundary was probably flood controlled while the outer boundary was probably fire controlled on the plain and topographically controlled by hills to the east. Rare examples of swamp scrub and grassland remain.

N2  - Early FNCV members, the brothers Charles and Thomas Brittlebank pursued their varied interests in natural history in the Werribee Gorge district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They compiled one of the first comprehensive bird lists for the area. Charles was a renowned artist and contributed illustrations of birds and their eggs, insects, fungi and mistletoes for pioneering works on thoise subjects by AJ Cambpell, JA Leach, Charles French, Daniel McAlpine and himself. He published widely and was considered an authority on the evidence for glacial action in Werribee Gorge. Thomas was a skilled egg collector, bird observer, landscape artist and contributor to his brother's and AJ Campbell's studies. Together they helped to lay the foundations of natural history study in Victoria.

N2  - Between 2001 and 2005, surveys of vertebrate fauna in three crown land conservation reserves in South Gippsland were commissioned by Parks Victoria. During these surveys new locality records were obtained for several species of small reptiles, including the vulnerable Swamp Skink Egernia coventryi. Incidental records were also obtained from local residents during this period, resulting in one new locality record for the Swamp Skink and two other species that had not previously been recorded in this part of southern Victoria. Habitat preference of the Swamp Skink is discussed.

N2  - Adults of the Australian Painted Lady Vanessa kershawi were recorded visiting the flowers of 17 species of plants for nectar, in bushland of northern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. More than half of these were native plants, predominantly in the family Myrtaceae. Most of the plants visited were dicotyledons. The growth forms of the plants visited by V. kershawi ranged from herbs, through to shrubs and one species of tree. All native flowers visited by V. kershawi were white or cream coloured. Flowers of weed species visited were white, yellow, purple or orange. Tubular, cupshaped and dish-shaped or open flowers were fed upon by V. kershawi. In the wild, ready availability of nectar may be the overriding factor in determining flower selection by V. kershawi adults. V. kershawi may play a role in the pollination of many of the 17 plant species recorded in this study. As a migratory butterfly species, V. kershawi may be involved in the long range dispersal of the pollen of a number of common native and exotic plant species.

N2  - The occurrence of snakes on private properties concerns many residents. Translocation of snakes by licensed snake catchers from private properties to public land is a common management practice in many urbanised areas in Australia. However, little is known about the practices of the snake catchers and the effectiveness of this management in terms of solving human-snake conflict. Mail questionnaires were used to survey licensed snake catchers from South Australia, and South Australian and Victorian residents who have used snake catchers. Catchers received calls from spring to autumn. The most frequently relocated snakes in South Australia were Brown Snakes Pseudonaja spp. Catchers chose release sites based on permit stipulations, perceived suitability of habitat, and likelihood of repeat encounters with humans. Residents detailed various beliefs for the occurrence of snakes on their property, including prey and shelter availability, and proximity to 'snake habitat', and, after first having a snake removed from their property, most found snakes subsequently. These repeat encounters suggest that education regarding snake encounters and discouraging snakes from entering/staying on their properties should be provided to residents, and that alternative management strategies for snakes in urban areas should be investigated.

N2  - In Little Penguins Eudyptula minor there are no reliable plumage or body size differences that can be used visually to distinguish the sex of individuals. However, sexual dimorphism of morphometric measures has been noted, with males always being a little larger than females. In this study, differences between E. minor sexes at eight colonies in south-eastern Australia were determined statistically via discriminant function analysis (DFA) and through the utilization of DNA-based techniques developed for non-ratite birds. The DFA correctly determined gender in 91.1% of cases and molecular methods were 100% accurate. Our DFA success rate of classification is similar to that previously published for Little Penguins in Victoria. In this study statistically significant differences in mean bill depths and lengths were found between Little Penguin colonies at St Kilda, Phillip Island and Gabo Island, compared to colonies at Kangaroo Island, Granite Island, Middle Island and London Bridge. As birds in eastern populations (St Kilda, Phillip Island, Gabo Island) exhibit statistically significantly smaller beaks (bill depth and bill length), separate discriminant functions were investigated for each phenotypically distinct geo-spatial cohort. Interestingly, cluster analysis for bill length identified three groups: western (Kangaroo Island and Granite Island), eastern (St Kilda, Phillip Island and Middle Island) and the London Bridge Little Penguin colony, which constituted a separate group. We conclude that while there is a slight increase in DF power for colonies west of Cape Otway and for some specific colonies, colony-specific DFA is not required to identify the sex of Little Penguins in south-eastern Australia.

N2  - Mortality due to road trauma can have large negative impacts on some populations and often is biased towards age/sex classes that have higher rates of movement: individuals during the breeding season and juveniles while they are dispersing. A bias towards young males has been found in two previous studies of road kill Koalas in southeast Queensland. Such a bias was not found in the present study of Koala skulls from populations across Victoria. This may be due to the different Koala population structures and densities or road types and characteristics.

N2  - The Golden Sun Moth Synemon plana is a small diurnal moth that is critically endangered in Australia. The species had been known from just six areas in Victoria until 2003, when new populations were discovered at the Craigieburn and Cooper Street Grasslands north of Melbourne. In response to these discoveries, Biosis Research Pty Ltd has undertaken a number of targeted surveys for Golden Sun Moth as part of ecological investigations of land proposed for development around Melbourne. This report provides a general outline of the species' habitat requirements and biology, and briefly describes the discovery of additional populations and implications of these survey results.

N2  - The stalked cup-fungus Banksiamyces is reported from 13 wild and one cultivated Banksia species. The geographic range of Banksiamyces is expanded to include Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW. Forty-five collections of Banksiamyces were examined in detail for a range of macro- and micro-morphological characters. Amongst the collections were all four of the previously described Banksiamyces species (B. katerinae, B. maccannii, B. macrocarpus and B. toomansis). Some collections that did not accord with these taxa were assigned to Banksiamyces aff. macrocarpus and B. aff. toomansis. The two species B. katerinae and B. toomansis appeared closer than initially proposed. The strict host-specific relationship suggested by some earlier studies was not confirmed. Evidence is provided for production of the fruit-body in early spring, and production of multiple crops of the same species on the one cone over successive fruiting seasons. Apothecia of these crops are of different macroscopic appearance, with lighter apothecia being mostly immature, and darker apothecia producing spores. This phenomenon may explain previous observations of seemingly different species on the same cone.

N2  - A study of the bird communities of two public reserves near Wagga Wagga on the NSW South Western Slopes recorded 127 species including 26 woodland species considered to be declining in the region (seven of which are currently listed as threatened under NSW state legislation) and 49 woodland species at risk of decline, as well as a range of agricultural species and waterbirds. Ninetythree species were recorded in Berry Jerry State Forest and 108 species in The Rock Nature Reserve, with 74 species found in both. Differences between the bird communities of the two reserves are in part a reflection of the different habitats available, with Berry Jerry State Forest supporting a diverse aquatic bird community in addition to the terrestrial bird community. Species in the 'declining' and 'at risk' categories made up approximately two thirds of the terrestrial bird communities of both reserves, and both reserves are considered to be close to losing a number of these species. Comparison of records from 1995-2003 and 1975-1981 suggests that Berry Jerry State Forest may have lost four species of its declining woodland bird community (Speckled Warbler Chthonicola sagittata, Eastern Yellow Robin Eopsaltria australis, White-browed Babbler Pomatostomus superciliosus and Diamond Firetail Stagonopleura guttata) over the past two decades. Both Berry Jerry State Forest and The Rock Nature Reserve are considered to be of regional significance for bird conservation. A combination of local- and regional-scale management actions is necessary if they are to maintain viable bird communities. (The Victorian Naturalist 124 (1), 2007, 4-18).

N2  - This paper examines the distribution of Yarrow Achillea millefolium L. (Asteraceae), in the Snowy Mountains. Location data from species specific surveys, field experiments and 18 general vegetation surveys were mapped in relation to altitude/floristic zone, climatic parameters (rainfall and temperature) and location of roads and tracks. Achillea millefolium is less common with increasing altitude and benefits from human disturbance. Using all location data, Yarrow was found at 376 sites; nearly all associated with human disturbance (91% of sites) mostly road or trail verges (72%) and around buildings and other ski tourism infrastructure. It occurred along 100 km of public access roads, management trails and walking tracks, from the tableland to the alpine zone (800 m to 2100 m altitude). The general vegetation surveys, however, indicate that although it can be found in 15% of disturbed sites, it is uncommon in undisturbed vegetation (4%). Yarrow occurred at high density around buildings and low density along walking tracks in the species specific surveys. The distribution of A. millefolium demonstrates that human disturbance provides favourable habitats for weeds even in mountains. Although its distribution was affected by altitude, A. millefolium was able to establish and grow on some of the highest mountains in Australia, along tracks. Increased disturbances as well as climate change are likely to facilitate its spread. (The Victorian Naturalist, 124 (1), 2007, 52-63)

N2  - Throughout the six years till 2005 Little Penguins Eudyptula minor at Middle Island, Warrnambool, have been subjected to intense fox predation. The population of the Little Penguin at Middle Island is now dangerously low, with a reduction from 342 active burrows in 1999 to the current 52 active burrows, and from 502 to 4 Little Penguins arriving at the colony after dusk. Such a reduction in numbers requires urgent management measures in order for the colony to survive.

N2  - The growth of a white crustose lichen growing on concrete gravestones at the Point Lonsdale Cemetery was investigated. It was found that the growth rate of the lichen could be determined by using the date on the headstone, and that larger lichens tended to have a greater rate of growth. Orientation of the longest lichen axis was non-random and appears to be related to the direction of rain-bearing winds.

N2  - Introduced tree hosts of creeping mistletoe in Heidelberg, Victoria, were resurveyed after an interval of ten years. There was substantial turnover of hosts in the decade, and increasing disparity in the density of both infected trees and mistletoes between the elevated western block compared to the adjacent valley slopes to the east, with more than five times the density of infected trees and ten times more mistletoes in the west. Different potential host densities between the sites do not explain the differences in infection rates.

N2  - In late November 2005 a survey was carried out for Common Death Adder Acanthophis antarcticus on Lindsay and Wallpolla Islands along the Murray River. No sighting of this species were made but a De Vis' Banded Snake Denisonia devisi was collected, representing the first record of the species in Victoria. Further specimens of the snake were recorded locally in other surveys, pointing to the value of baseline survey. Ongoing surveys of herpetofauna are essential and until more is known of the conservation status of De Vis' Banded Snake in Victoria; caution is recommended regarding landuse that could potentially threaten the species.

N2  - Prompted by nostalgia and economic hopes, but without an ecological understanding of the world, Ferdinand Mueller and other Europeans sought to 'improve' the Colony of Victoria by introducing useful and attractive species. As Government Botanist (1853-96), Mueller introduced an enormous diversity of foreign plants for cultivation and naturalization, and, while Director of Melbourne's Botanic Garden (1857-73), tested their colonial viability. From 1858 to 1861 Mueller was the honorary secretary of a management committee for a collection of birds and animals resident in the Botanic Garden; and, for the following twelve years, vice-president of a society which grew out of that committee - the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria, which was devoted to the introduction of species with economic and aesthetic appeal. Even after losing the Botanic Garden, Mueller continued to publicise and popularise the introduction of desirable plants, meanwhile providing weed information and advice.

Of native plant pathogenic fungi, Chalara australis affecting Myrtle Beech is probably causing the most disease. Of fungi not yet present in Australia, Guava Rust Puccinia psidii and Sudden Oak Death Phytophthora ramorum are seen as the most significant potential diseases of native plants, while the Australian daisy rust Puccinia lagenophorae is a surprising invasive pathogen in Europe and North America.

N2  - Weed control is an emotive issue and all land managers have to deal with it, often with limited funds. Land managers, however, are usually motivated to prioritise control of weeds having an obvious impact on their use of the land, for example those that are already well established and abundant. Recently, an increasing focus has been given to preventing weed spread early in the invasion process, that is, by attempting to eradicate particular species long before they expand and become widespread. Land managers need to identify the present and future priority weeds so that resources can be focused on them. This paper describes a generic process or contingency plan to assist in developing either local, regional or state plans to identify and act upon new and emerging pest plants.

N2  - A high number of exotic invertebrate species has been accidentally or deliberately introduced into Victoria since European settlement. The effects of these introductions on native flora and fauna have ranged from benign through to devastating, depending upon the species in question and on the context of their introduction. Exotic species are generally easier to identify, and in the case of potential future invasive species identified through such processes as pest risk analysis combined with vigilant quarantine inspection processes, it is possible to anticipate and identify potential paths of entry to prevent incursions in the first instance. However, subsequently dealing with exotic pests that have successfully established and native invertebrate species that have become pests is a more complex scenario. This paper discusses some of the significant exotic invertebrates to have established in Victoria and their impacts on the environment, either beneficial, benign or adverse. Impacts of exotic invertebrates on amenity plantings and forests are examined, as well as issues covering invasive native invertebrates establishing outside of either their normal host or geographic range. Broad actions to prevent or limit the spread of exotic and native invasive invertebrates are also discussed.

N2  - Three of the four members of the genus Manorina have been linked to declines in bird diversity and abundance; they are the Noisy Miner M. melanocephala, the Bell Miner M. melanophrys, and the Yellow-throated Miner M. flavigula. The negative influence of these species in remnant vegetation appears to be spreading in eastern Australia. Some habitat restoration and revegetation programs have the potential to exacerbate the problems associated with these species by inadvertently creating additional habitat for them to dominate. Better understanding of the habitat preferences of miners can guide restoration efforts so that they decrease the likelihood of undesirable outcomes. This contribution is based upon an article that appeared in the State of Australian Birds Report 2006, as a supplement to Wingspan vol 16, no. 4, 2006.

N2  - This paper examines whether a community-based approach to the biological control (biocontrol) of Bridal Creeper Asparagus asparagoides L. Druce can be effective in reducing the impact of the weed. Bridal Creeper is a serious threat to native vegetation on Victoria's Bellarine Peninsula. In many situations, such as occurs at Buckley Park Foreshore Reserve, Bridal Creeper can be difficult to control without serious off-target damage. Implementing the biocontrol of Bridal Creeper is therefore seen as a priority. A model for a community-based biocontrol program was adopted on the Peninsula to facilitate the spread and impact of biocontrol agents. The program has required a close collaboration between researchers, land managers, and community groups, including local schools. As a result of the program biocontrol agents have been released at 46 sites on the Bellarine peninsula. Two agents in particular are now spreading and causing visible damage to bridal creeper infestations. The program has demonstrated the important role biocontrol can play in the integrated management of a widespread environmental weed, and provides a strong basis for future collaboration at a local level in weed management issues.

N2  - The Large Earth Bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an invasive species that has not yet established on the Australian mainland. However, a feral population was discovered in Tasmania in 1992 and applications have been made to import the species to the Australian mainland for pollination of crops inside greenhouses. The introduction of B. terrestris to the Australian mainland for pollination of greenhouse crops poses a potential threat to Australia's biodiversity because: (1) B. terrestris is likely to escape from captivity and form feral populations in the wild across a large area; (2) B. terrestris forages on many species of native and introduced plants and has spread rapidly throughout all major native vegetation types in Tasmania; (3) B. terrestris is able to reduce the amounts of nectar available to other animals by foraging at lower temperatures than other bees; and (4) the effectiveness of B. terrestris as a pollinator sometimes differs from that of other animals. Recent research suggests that B. terrestris is reducing reproductive success in an endangered species of bird in Tasmania by reducing nectar availability, and several species of introduced plants have become more invasive in Tasmania since B. terrestris arrived there.

N2  - Many of the threats to our native flora, including habitat destruction, weed infestations, rabbits, are glaringly obvious. Hybridisation between native and 'introduced' species and introduced plant species acting as hosts for introduced pests are two threats that are generally overlooked by the casual observer. Examples are given of these two threats to our native plants. The implications of hybridisation and introduced plants acting as hosts on the long-term survival of our natural heritage are discussed.

N2  - Small patches of remnant vegetation at Safety Beach, on the Mornington Peninsula, are described. Floristic and historical evidence are examined, in an attempt to reconstruct the vegetation of this area before colonisation. There is strong evidence that the plains between the slopes of Mt Martha and Arthurs Seat once supported patches of seasonally 'boggy' natural grassland sparsely timbered with Blackwood Acacia melanoxylon. The plain also supported patches of Swamp Paperbark Melaleuca ericifolia scrub, and numerous wetlands. Previous mapping exercises have not identified grasslands on the Mornington Peninsula. The observations presented here add to a growing awareness that patches of grassland were once scattered through low-lying areas of South Gippsland. The ecology of these areas is discussed, along with the prospects for their conservation on the Mornington Peninsula. This paper records the presence of several significant plant taxa, including Golden Cowslips Diuris behrii (vulnerable in Victoria) and Purple Blown-grass Lachnagrostis punicea subsp. punicea (rare in Victoria).

N2  - Extensive land clearing in western Victoria has lead to land degradation, loss of natural habitat and poor water quality. Tree planting has been used to combat these problems and improve biodiversity, but whether these programs are meeting their nature conservation objectives is equivocal. Here we examined the presence of birds and mammals in 12 revegetated sites of different ages and habitat complexity and four remnant habitat sites. We found remnant sites had the greatest abundance in species richness of both birds and mammals, and that use of revegetated sites increased as the sites aged and became more structurally complex.

N2  - It was once common to include studies of Aboriginal culture and history within the purview of natural history studies. This perspective changed in Victoria from the early 1970s, with the concurrent development of a number of avenues for professional fieldwork and publication related to studying the Aboriginal past. These developments are detailed here along with the long-term impacts they had for the involvement of the FNCV in Aboriginal studies. (The Victorian Naturalist 124 (3), 2007, )

N2  - Fifteen adult Eastern Long-necked Turtles Chelodina longicollis (13 males, 2 females) were removed from billabongs located within the Ovens River floodplain, Victoria, during the summer of 1997/98 to examine their feeding preference in captivity, away from competitors, in a controlled environment. Four prey items were presented to the captive turtles: naucorids (Family Naucoridae), corixids (Family Corixidae), gudgeons (Hypseleotris klunzingeri) and caddisfly larvae (Family Leptoceridae). In total, 12.9% of prey was consumed without any dietary preference shown by turtles. It was concluded that turtles in captivity fed passively and opportunistically. Clearly, this may differ from their foraging strategy in the wild where the anti-predator behaviour of prey can differ greatly in the presence of refugia in a much larger and more complex habitat.

N2  - Austrogammarus australis (Sayce) and A. haasei (Sayce) (Amphipoda: Paramelitidae) are two amphipod species of conservation significance located in the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria. Original type localities for the species were in and near the Dandenong Ranges. Subsequent surveys have revealed that both species are no longer found at their type localities (most likely due to impacts associated with urbanisation), however they do occur at other sites in the Dandenong Ranges. As the species have a limited distribution in Victoria, they are listed under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The Draft Advisory List of Threatened Invertebrates classifies A. australis as 'Vulnerable' and A. haasei as 'Critically Endangered'.This paper sumarises results from three surveys for both species with additional notes on changes in their distribution over time. A slight increase in the number of sites at which both species were found was evident from surveys for the species in 1995 and 1999. A survey for the species in 2001 in the Yarra Ranges, an area located close by with similar topography, stream types and vegetation, failed to locate any specimens of either species, highlighting the limited distribution of the species. There have been no taxon-specific surveys for either species across the Dandenong Ranges since 1999.

N2  - This paper summarises some aspects of the practical conservation needs of the Eltham Copper Butterfly Paralucia pyrodiscus lucida, a small threatened subspecies of butterfly endemic to Victoria, Australia. The butterfly is located in three disjunct regions, separated by hundreds of kilometres across the state as a result of habitat removal and degradation. The three areas of ECB occurrence each have distinct characteristics affecting the needs and intensity of conservation management on the various sites given their urban, regional and rural settings. Butterfly populations have been monitored nearly every year since 1988 with the active support of volunteers, 'Friends of Eltham Copper Butterfly', local councils and government agencies. This information has contributed to a more holistic management regime for the butterfly, and further research aims to elucidate the more intricate details of the butterfly's biology, to continue to refine the current monitoring process across the state of Victoria.

N2  - Abstract It is difficult to identify the main factors that determine the distribution of the Giant Gippsland Earthworm because of the completely subterranean nature of this species. Past emphasis has involved research on soil factors (such as texture and chemical composition) and topography (slope, aspect, proximity to water). More recent research indicates that its distribution results from a combination of many interrelated factors, most importantly, underground hydrological processes. The pre- European settlement environment for the Giant Gippsland Earthworm was predominantly tall wet forest, but it has survived in pockets of exotic pastures and riparian zones. However, some of the revegetation programmes established to address degraded habitat may ultimately be detrimental to surviving populations of the Giant Gippsland Earthworm.

N2  - Captive breeding is an underrated aspect of invertebrate conservation programs, sometimes seen as expensive and of little value to the overall conservation goal. The Lord Howe Island (LHI) Stick Insect project demonstrates the benefits of captive breeding, despite the inherent difficulties in dealing with a species about which nothing was known, which began in captivity with a small founder population, which has required a number of veterinary treatments and which has demonstrated apparent inbreeding depression requiring ongoing genetic management. Ex situ breeding at Melbourne Zoo has so far grown the captive population to more than ten times the wild population with very little financial contribution from participating organisations, ensuring a more secure future whilst in situ conservation measures are undertaken.

N2  - The endemic damselfly Hemiphlebia mirabilis S lys has been a focus of conservation attention since its rediscovery in Victoria was publicised in the mid 1980s. It was listed under the state's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (FFG) in 1991. Discovery of additional colonies has indicated that Hemiphlebia is far more widespread than earlier supposed, and continued study indicates that it is variously secure or vulnerable in different places - rather than 'endangered', as previously thought. The history of study of the species is summarised briefly, and its values in promoting awareness of insect conservation as a 'flagship species' in southern Australia are discussed.

N2  - Abstract The aquatic insects are still poorly represented in terms of conservaiton and protection in Victoria. The main impediments for this were identified over a decade ago and all remain valid today. Recent national collections of aquatic invertebrates have been used to determine distribution and habitat requirements for more than 200 macro-inveterbrates, and this has enabled the identification of a number of species that have restricted distributions and may be candidates for conservation listing. An example, using the mayfly genus Coloburiscoides, highlights how the perception that these animals are widespread and common may mask the reality of individual species being rare and restricted in their distribution, and that the effects of climate change may hasten their decline.

Quolls were detected only at sites that either did not burn or were patchily burnt. Quolls were still not detected in areas that were burnt intensely three years after the fires. The implications of the survey results suggest that the species could have suffered a 35-50% population decline due to the fires.

This is the first record of occurrences of this fossil in the distal turbidite facies of the Yea area, which have previously been controversially dated as Late Silurian. Two of the three localities at which it has been found appear to contain Early Devonian fossil assemblages typical of central Victoria. A lectotype specimen of P. megastoma is designated and assigned a Pragian-Emsian (Early Devonian) age but other specimens have been recorded from Silurian sediments.

This short paper presents the results of a study of the land snails of Bruxner Park, a small conservation reserve near Coffs Harbour on the NSW North Coast, and provides information on the range of interesting land snail species found there. Bruxner Park is one of the richest known sites for land snail diversity on the NSW North Coast, with 30 species recorded to date and more likely to occur there. This high diversity is particularly notable given the acidic, calcium-poor nature of the soils present.

N2  - Acacia scrubs are an unusual vegetation community in the Upper Snowy River region of Victoria and New South Wales, occurring as sharply-delineated patches amongst eucalypt forest on steep, rocky, north to west facing slopes. They can be dominated by a range of Acacia species, but understoreys of Acacia scrubs are generally reported as sparse and species poor, and little is known of their ecology. Extensive wildfires in 2003 provided an opportunity to compare the effects of mild and intense fires on plant species composition and vigour in Acacia scrub communities of the Little River Gorge in eastern Victoria. Acacia scrubs at this site were dominated by Acacia doratoxylon, not previously described as a dominant in Acacia scrubs in Victoria. Consistent with earlier observations, understoreys in unburnt scrubs were usually sparse. Light burns led to minimal change in understorey abundance, and sporadic establishment of a range of species that were uncommon in the understorey of unburnt sites. By contrast, burns that were intense enough to kill the Acacia overstorey stimulated dense establishment and profuse growth of species that were rare or absent in the understorey of unburnt plots, leading to a dramatic increase in native shrub richness and understorey abundance. Processes leading to these understorey changes are likely to involve both effects of fire on seed dormancy, and release from intense competition for resources after overstorey death. Infrequent, intense fires have previously been recognised as important for stimulating recruitment of overstorey species and thus the perpetuation of Acacia scrubs in far south-eastern Australia. This study indicated that a diverse range of understorey species are also dependent on intense fires in these communities, where they appear to behave as post-fire ephemerals. Further, many of these species are listed as rare or vulnerable in Victoria, and thus the appropriate fire management of Acacia scrubs is of significant conservation interest.

N2  - Abstract The finding of the nursery burrow of a Short-beaked Echidna close to the house of the two senior authors allowed close observation and monitoring of breeding behaviour. Two young emerged from the nursery burrow eight days apart. Individual colour-marking of the mother and both young allowed their movements and behaviour to be monitored over subsequent months. Data are presented on post-emergence suckling of both young, which continued for 60 days after emergence, and included one instance when both were suckled simultaneously. Information is also presented on the movements, survival, and selection of shelter-sites by the juveniles. The two juveniles are likely to be twins, though they are not identical twins. These observations provide the first record of a female echidna successfully raising more than one young in a single breeding season, and the first records of parental care of young echidnas after they have vacated the nursery burrow.

N2  - In the absence of Australian data about methods to control House Sparrows Passer domesticus this paper investigates the role of harbour removal and trapping to eliminate a House Sparrow infestation from a farm property near Mansfield, Victoria. Over 23 years, 630 House Sparrows were captured and the property has had no resident sparrows for 13 years. Benefits from the removal of House Sparrows are listed. Over the past 10 years, records of captured dispersing House Sparrows from other locations indicate that 85% of these birds arrived during summer and less than 1% during midwinter to late spring. Once resident sparrow numbers were reduced to zero, birds arriving appeared nervous and usually dispersed before the trap was set. Based on this work, trapping is most effective during the dispersal period. These findings should encourage others to view House Sparrows as pests that can be eliminated with judicious trapping (care, skill and observation) and the removal of harbors. It is proposed that the effective use of trapping over a catchment scale based on homestead action should be able to reduce or eliminate House Sparrows from Australia.

N2  - A review of the published literature suggested that plants with a clonal growth habit dominated the vegetation of wetlands in many parts of the world. To test whether this pattern held in Australia, the distribution of plants with clonal and non-clonal growth habits was examined in Clydebank Morass, a brackish-water wetland of the Gippsland Lakes in south-eastern Victoria. Nineteen of the twenty species of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants present in the wetland were clonal. In terms of both species number and percentage cover, clonal plants dominated the vegetation in wet and intermittently damp parts of the Morass whereas non-clonal plants were progressively more common as elevations increased. This elevational effect was due more to changes in soil moisture content than in soil salinity. These results not only confirmed the prediction that clonal plants were the dominant growth habit in the wetland but were consistent with predictions made in the 1960s as to likely vegetation changes as the Gippsland Lakes became progressively salinised. Understanding the dominance of wetlands by clonal plants has implications for assessments of plant fitness and the maintenance of plant biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity; it is central also to improving the success with which degraded wetlands are rehabilitated.

N2  - Ground-dwelling invertebrates are an important component of the box-ironbark forest ecosystem, but have been relatively little studied. This study quantified the composition, size and seasonal variation in biomass of leaf litter invertebrates in a box-ironbark forest in Victoria over a period of two years. Invertebrates were extracted using Tullgren funnels in one year and by hand-sorting in a subsequent year. Seven classes of arthropod were identified. Hymenoptera was the most numerous taxon comprising 22% and 29% of the invertebrates extracted in each year. Most invertebrates were small: 81% extracted using Tullgren funnels (minimum length 0.1 mm) and 77% extracted by hand-sorting had a body length of less than 5.0 mm. There was significant seasonal variation in the biomass of the leaf litter invertebrates, with a short peak of one to two months' duration from the end of winter, that is, at the end of the coldest and wettest period of weather. The time of lowest biomass was during the summer months (December, January and February), the hottest and driest period of the year. The biomass of leaf litter invertebrates was significantly correlated with the moisture content of the leaf litter.

N2  - The Golden Sun Moth Synemon plana is a medium-sized diurnal moth considered to be critically endangered in Australia. The discovery of new populations around Melbourne since 2002 suggest that S. plana is more widespread and may have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought. A survey was undertaken during the species' 2006/7 flight season, with the aim of improving our understanding of its distribution in the Melbourne area. This report summarises the findings of that survey.

N2  - Increasing altitude can result in reduced diversity of exotic plants while disturbance usually benefits exotics. Species richness and cover of exotics was examined in paired 120 m2 roadside and adjacent natural vegetation plots at 10 sites along a 1000 m altitudinal gradient from montane to the alpine zone in the Snowy Mountains. Species richness and cover of exotics decreased linearly with increasing altitude in both habitats. The effect of altitude was partly off set by disturbance, with more species and greater cover of exotics on roadside plots. There was high diversity of annual/biennial forbs particularly at low altitude, and few exotic annuals/biennials above 1510 m. The decline in diversity with altitude may be due to differences in disturbance history, with the highest plots having lower levels of use, but the decline in diversity is most likely due to differences in environmental conditions with increasing altitude that limit exotics, particularly annuals/biennials.

N2  - The web-based casual sightings network 'Auscetnet' receives an average 13 records of Killer Whales per year, mainly from coastal locations of southeast Australia. These data combined with data from the Atlas of Victorian Wildlife are presented to illustrate the pattern of monthly sightings. Sightings peak in late June/early July and again between September and November. There is a distinct decline in sightings between late July and the end August. One individual Killer Whale has been seen twice off the central coast of Victoria and twice off southern New South Wales since 2002, suggesting some Victorian Killer Whales occupy home ranges that extend into NSW waters, although the vast majority of sightings are from south of about 36 S. Sighting frequency is unlikely to reflect the species' true abundance and despite frequent records off Victoria and southern NSW, they may be uncommon. There is no evidence to characterise movement patterns but Killer Whales are likely to respond to changes in prey availability, influenced partly by the East Australian Current. Killer Whales have been observed feeding on sharks, sunfish, Humpback Whales and Australian Fur Seals in the region.

N2  - Millipedes and other litter invertebrates were sampled in forest patches scattered over approximately 3000 km of southwest Victorian farmland, mainly between the Eumeralla and Hopkins Rivers. Three new, geographically restricted species of Somethus (Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae) were collected. Litter fauna in the sampled patches, apart from Framlingham Forest, included few species that are poor dispersers. Absences may be the historical legacy of past habitat fragmentation, subsequent local extinctions and a very low probability of patch recolonisation.

The frequency of sightings peaked at both sites in winter, which is also the season when Platypus were most frequently captured in live-trapping surveys carried out in the Yarra catchment. The number of Platypus seen at Toorourrong Reservoir increased with cloud cover, though this relationship accounted for only 4% of the total daily variability in the frequency of sightings.

N2  - The Southern Brown Bandicoot Isoodon obesulus has declined dramatically in both range and abundance since European Settlement. The species' distribution is largely determined by the availability of the dense, heathy vegetation that formed on the sandy coastal plains of south-eastern Australia. One of the five major areas of habitat in Victoria occurred in the Port Phillip-Western Port-West Gippsland region of Victoria. This 'south central' region is one of the most populated and developed regions in Australia, and habitat suitable for Southern Brown Bandicoots has become rare, highly fragmented and influenced by a range of potentially threatening processes. We looked at the historic and current distribution of Southern Brown Bandicoots in the south central region to identify options for conservation management of the species. We found evidence that populations in the Greater Melbourne area, including the Mornington Peninsula, had declined substantially in recent decades. The species is now uncommon in administratively secure conservation reserves in the region apart from the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne, where recent management initiatives appear to have been effective in controlling some known threats. Surprisingly, an extensive population also persists on predominantly agricultural and utility land north of Western Port Bay, around the former 'Great' (Koo-wee-rup) Swamp where they live close to humans, livestock and domestic pets. This population faces a number of immediate threats, yet may be crucial to the long term viability of the species in the south central region. Effective management of the Koo-wee-rup population will require innovative measures to mitigate threats across a range of land uses and tenures.

N2  - The development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system is the key objective of the National Reserve System, and is supported by all Australian States and Territories. In Victoria, the purchase of private land for incorporation into the parks and reserves system assists in the protection of some of the State's most endangered ecosystems. This article outlines the ecological attributes of private land purchased for addition to the Victorian public protected area system in 2006 and 2007.

N2  - Despite the important role of vascular epiphytes in temperate rainforests, there are gaps in the literature regarding the factors driving their distribution patterns, including host tree specificity. This brief study attempts to determine the host preferences and relative abundance of the Finger Fern Grammitis billardieri (Willd.) in Cool Temperate Rainforest and Wet Sclerophyll Forest at Mt. Erica, Victoria. Both the type of host used and the relative abundance of the Finger Fern were significantly associated with vegetation type. The distribution of this species appears to be related to host characteristics, and therefore the conservation of this species will largely depend on the management of host tree populations, especially within the threatened temperate rainforest ecosystems.

N2  - A remnant stand of Grassy White Box Woodland, containing trees that had been monitored for abundance of reproductive structures since 2000, was burnt by wildfire in late 2006. Very little seed was present in the aerial seedbank of White Box at the time of the fire and, due to the destruction of the newly-forming capsules, seed is likely to be in short supply in the near future. Seedling recruitment of White Box was minimal after the fire. However, the existing woodland structure is likely to be maintained as most of the fire-damaged trees regenerated vegetatively. Most of the other native perennials, woody and herbaceous, regenerated vegetatively, but exotics - mostly annuals - increased markedly via seedling recruitment during the year following the fire.

N2  - Water Rats are widely distributed throughout a variety of habitats and are known to be opportunistic predators. Their occupation in coastal areas often occurs within Little Penguin colonies, but interactions between the two species have not previously been reported. Given that Water Rats prey on other bird species, it is likely that they will also take young or weak Little Penguins. Here the case of a Little Penguin chick death that has been attributed to an attack by a Water Rat is reported.

N2  - The moss genus Hymenodon Hook.f. and Wilson (Rhizogoniaceae) comprises eleven species but is represented in Victoria by a single species, Hymenodon pilifer Hook.f. and Wilson. Its main habitat is the trunks of tree-ferns and trees (rarely rock or clay banks) in cool temperate rainforest. Its conservation status appears to be 'secure' nationally and in Victoria and Tasmania, but is uncertain in New South Wales and Queensland.

N2  - The current population of Eastern Grey Kangaroos Macropus giganteus on Wilsons Promontory National Park are descendants of nine animals released in the park in 1910 and 1912. Immediately prior to that there were no kangaroos in the park. There is much historic evidence to suggest that there have never been kangaroos on the Prom, but there is also one piece of information that indicates that there were kangaroos there in the second half of the 19th century. This paper draws together historic records and discusses the evidence for and against kangaroos being indigenous to the Prom. Although not conclusive, the evidence is compelling in the negative.

N2  - The germination characteristics of Mountain Celery Aciphylla glacialis (Apiaceae) were investigated. This species failed to germinate in conditions that nine other alpine species from the same region found favourable. Seeds were collected from eight mountain peaks in the Victorian alpine zone. These peaks formed an altitudinal gradient of 302 m. The seeds were subjected to a cold-wet stratification treatment in an attempt to overcome what appeared to be seed dormancy. After approximately 15 weeks of the cold-wet stratification treatment, A. glacialis seeds began to germinate. Germination rates were fastest among seeds from the mid to high altitude sites, which also had the greatest percentage of seeds to germinate. Mt Speculation (1668 m) and Mt Bogong (1970 m) had the lowest percentage of germination from seeds collected in 2004. Among seeds collected in 2005, the lowest values were from Mt Bogong. Comparing seed collected in 2004 and 2005, there was no significant difference between final per cent germination from any site. There were no significant relationships between altitude and germination characteristics. There were several significant differences in the probability of seed germination between sites. However, there was no overall trend in the probability of seed germination between high and low altitude sites. The role of seed dormancy mechanisms in relation to the alpine environment is discussed and the role of altitudinal gradients in relation to seed germination in this species is speculated upon.

N2  - Following the 1996 trapping of a single Smoky Mouse Pseudomys fumeus beside the upper reaches of the Buchan River near Native Dog Flat in the Alpine National Park, a number of attempts to record the species at the site in recent years have been unsuccessful. In November 2006, three individual Smoky Mouse were trapped in the immediate vicinity of the 1996 site. The discovery that the species still persists at the site is significant as Smoky Mouse populations are small and fragmented and there is evidence of population fluctuations and apparent local extinctions. Apart from the Grampians this is the first record of Smoky Mouse from Victoria for four years. This article describes the history of Smoky Mouse trapping and searches at Native Dog Flat and details methods and results of the successful trapping session in November 2006.

N2  - A survey of spiders was conducted at a location in the Yarra Valley over 8 days to assess the relationship between habitat structure and spider family richness. Four different habitat types were sampled: slightly disturbed grazed pasture, disturbed grazed pasture, open dry forest and dense dry forest. Six different trapping methods were used. Spider families were richer in the more complex forest sites, and less rich in the less complex pasture habitats. When broken down into groups based on hunting strategy, fewer groups were found in the pasture sites, while more hunting strategy groups were present in the forest sites. Non web-building and ground-hunting spiders dominated the pasture sites. These groups were present in the forest sites, but webbuilding spiders were also found. This is attributed to the more complex vegetation, which provides greater habitat opportunities. The results support the hypothesis that spider family richness is related to habitat structure.

N2  - A one-off 18 km transect running from Kilcunda to Cape Patterson in south central Victoria was surveyed for coastal birds. This stretch of high-energy coastline has relatively few visitor access points. Eleven species of coastal birds were recorded using the coastline, ranging from the common Silver Gull Larus novaehollandiae through to species of conservation concern such as the Hooded Plover Thinornis rubricollis and Sooty Oystercatcher Haematopus fuliginosus. The density of Hooded Plovers was 0.89 birds/km and compares favourably with reported mean densities from other parts of mainland south-east Australia. This survey provides baseline density data for coastal birds for a relatively pristine stretch of coastline that is subject to development proposals such as water desalination plants and wind farms.

This paper refines the description of Coastal Moonah Woodland in the Gippsland Plain bioregion, provides a workable definition of the community, determines its relationships with similar communities and develops a Key to the community that can be used by land managers, planners and environmental consultants. As well, a Key to the transition states of Coastal Moonah Woodland is provided and these communities are described.

N2  - Mammal surveys were conducted at 16 farms on the Victorian Volcanic Plain, as part of a study on native grassland biodiversity. One hundred and forty-six hair tubes/funnels were laid at the 16 farms. Elliott traps were laid only at one farm, for 27 trap nights, in a small area with active disturbance indicative of the Swamp Rat Rattus lutreolus. No evidence of any small native mammals was discovered using hair tubes, funnels or Elliott traps. Th e only hair recovered was from a Cat Felis catus. These results are discussed from the perspective of small mammal decline on the Victorian Volcanic Plain and its ecological implications. Improved methods for detection of elusive grassland mammals are suggested.

N2  - The historical records of observations of birdlife within the Melbourne suburban area date from the beginning of European settlement, although they provide little hard evidence regarding local species. The activities of members of FNCV and other individuals, particularly from the early 1880s contributed to a better and more complete picture of local birds. Today, many of the species that were the subject of interest to collectors are rare or endangered. Thanks to the activities of those collectors, however, we can at least refer to a range of records to gain an understanding of the characteristics of the birds that once lived in the suburbs.

N2  - Several native bird species have recently successfully colonized many Australian cities. The presence of some of them may be largely beneficial, but their urban ecology is poorly understood. We conducted short-term studies of the foraging ecology of Rainbow and Musk Lorikeets and Red-rumped Parrots in Melbourne parklands to help fill this knowledge gap. The nectar (and/or pollen) of six eucalypt species, mostly not native to the Melbourne area, strongly dominated the lorikeets' diet year-round. The key eucalypt species variously flowered for 80-100% of winter and 72-84% of summer. In winter, 80% of the Red-rumped Parrot's diet comprised the abundant seeds of four exotic grasses and herbs. There was little evidence of significant inter-specific competition, particularly through aggressive interference, for any of the lorikeets' or parrots' urban food resources. Thus a critical factor facilitating urban colonization by these birds seems to be that, collectively, ornamental eucalypts planted last century, turf grasses commonly occurring on sports grounds and in parks and common weeds provide abundant food resources in Melbourne's parklands that are broadly similar to those of their non-urban habitats. Moreover, exploitation of these resources by other urban birds seems to be fairly limited.

N2  - The relationships between vegetation and bird communities within an urban landscape are synthetised, based on a series of studies we conducted. Our studies indicate that streetscape vegetation plays an important role in influencing urban bird communities, with streetscapes dominated by native plants supporting communities with high native species richness and abundance, while exotic and newly-developed streetscapes support more introduced bird species and fewer native bird species. Native streetscapes can also provide important resources for certain groups of birds, such as nectarivores. Our research has also revealed that urban remnants are likely to support more native bird species if they are larger and if they contain components of riparian vegetation. Vegetation structure and quality does not appear to be as important a driver as remnant size in determining the richness of native bird communities. Introduced birds were shown to occur in remnants at low densities, irrespective of remnant size, when compared to densities found in streetscapes dominated by exotic vegetation. We discuss our results in terms of practical planning and management options to increase and maintain urban avian diversity and conclude by offering suggestions for future fields of research in terms of urban bird communities.

N2  - Wetland buffers separate wetlands from surrounding land uses that are incompatible with wetland values. Buffers are established to fulfil a variety of needs. However, not all functions which are attributed to buffers are mutually compatible. In particular, their use as major recreational zones is not necessarily compatible with reducing disturbance to wetland wildlife, such as birds. This paper examines the buffer around an urban wetland at Altona, Victoria, which is extensively used by recreationists. The presence of a bicycle trail within the buffer might effectively reduce its size and effectiveness, and cause 'buffer creep' whereby the effective separation distance between people and birds is reduced. It might also unintentionally facilitate unauthorised access into an otherwise 'off-limits' wetland. While social support is critical for wetland conservation, the existence of recreation in buffers does not automatically confer high awareness of local wetlands. The success of buffers as a conservation tool will depend upon setting a clear objective for buffers, careful design and management, and evaluation of effectiveness to optimise the potential benefits for wetlands and their fauna.

N2  - Hybridisation is widespread in waterfowl and hybrids are often fertile. Mallards Anas platyrhynchos hybridise with numerous dabbling ducks and have been associated with decline in many Anas species with which they co-occur. Mallards have been introduced in Australia and New Zealand where they hybridise with indigenous Pacific Black Ducks Anas superciliosa. The extent of hybridisation in Australia is unknown, but Mallards pose a potentially serious threat to endemic duck populations and have already caused the extinction of some populations of Pacific Black Ducks in New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island. The distribution and abundance of Mallards and the extent of hybridisation in Australia must be determined as a priority to ensure the long-term genetic integrity of the Pacific Black Duck.

N2  - Conserving biodiversity is of utmost importance on a global scale. Species conservation, however, is a challenging task, which is often compounded by a lack of knowledge of target species. New advances in information technology and molecular techniques, however, are enabling conservation biologists to obtain large amounts of data quickly, which will certainly aid in assigning conservation priorities. This article reviews the use of genetics in conservation biology and highlights, using the Powerful Owl Ninox strenua as an example, how DNA can be a valuable source of data.

This paper presents data for some of the species that have declined, increased or remained constant in numbers during this period and mentions some factors responsible for these numbers.

N2  - Surveys of native grasslands for the Plains-wanderer Pedionomus torquatus were conducted at 12 survey sites on eight properties over five years on the Riverine Plain of southern New South Wales between November 2001 and December 2006. The main focus of these surveys was to undertake population monitoring of the threatened Plains-wanderer; however, all other vertebrate species detected, excluding macropods, also were recorded. A total of 4863 faunal observations were made, encompassing 35 native species: 24 species of bird, six reptiles, three amphibians and six mammals, of which four were introduced. Plains-wanderers were recorded at 11 of the 12 survey sites. (The Victorian Naturalist 126 (4) 2009, 128-134).

N2  - Expansion of open-cut coal mines in the La Trobe Valley, Victoria, will lead to the loss of native vegetation and vertebrate habitat. Corporations operating these mines have entered into agreements to manage offset areas for conservation values. Surveys of vertebrate fauna in seven offset areas and revegetation sites were carried out between February 2005 and May 2008. One hundred and twenty-eight species were recorded, comprising 21 mammals, 11 reptiles, eight amphibians and 88 birds. Several threatened species were recorded including Swamp Skink Egernia coventryi, Powerful Owl Ninox strenua, Australasian Shoveler Anas rhynchotis, Bluebilled Duck Oxyura australis, Eastern Great Egret Ardea modesta, Royal Spoonbill Platalea regia, and Whitebellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster. Several species had colonised revegetation areas and others were detected in degraded sites and isolated remnant patches. The ability of these species to survive in fragmented and disturbed habitats is discussed. The results of these surveys have implications for land managers planning conservation works or habitat enhancement programs especially in degraded sites.

N2  - In addition to its known former presence in Melbourne and Ballarat, in Victoria, the presence of the Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis in Adelaide, South Australia from 1917 to about 1922 is detailed. Founder animals were likely sourced from the Melbourne population, with the Adelaide Grey Squirrel population subsequently arising from escapes from the zoological gardens, or animals privately sourced from Toorak, Victoria. Relatively prompt action by Government to control the Squirrels saw a bounty offered and the apparent main population controlled by Adelaide City Council staff. The Squirrels, restricted to urban plantings of northern hemisphere trees, were subsequently eradicated and were last recorded in 1922. It is unknown what contribution either control method contributed to the eventual eradication of this introduced species. The successful eradication of the Grey Squirrel from Adelaide provides an additional international vertebrate pest eradication record to further our understanding of achieving success in this difficult but valuable pest management goal.

N2  - This descriptive study depicts a journey through the distribution and variation of the threatened plant community Coastal Moonah Woodland in Victoria. Extant remnants are distributed in three broad geographic regions. In the south-west, stands are scattered from the South Australian border through to Portland, with one small isolated remnant at Warrnambool. On the Surf Coast, remnants are scattered from Aireys Inlet through to Queenscliff on the Bellarine Peninsula. Remnants occur on the southern Mornington Peninsula, with adjunct stands on Phillip Island and Wilsons Promontory. the community varies in species composition, abundance and vegetation structure in relation to landscape position, exposure to coastal influences and disturbance history. the condition of remnants is generally poor due to their small size and coastal location where disturbance due to human activity and weed invasion is often high. the more isolated remnants in the south-west of the state appear to be better quality. This variety in vegetation structure and condition provides a diverse foundation for future enhancement of degraded Coastal Moonah Woodland remnants that may increase the success of conservation efforts.

N2  - The four Tasmanian specimens of the Earth Cress Geococcus pusillus J. Drumm. ex Harv. were collected on islands in Bass Strait. The nineteenth century record was made on King Island at the western end of the Strait. Its scanty details are set out below. The twentieth century specimens were collected at the Furneaux Group, in the south-eastern quarter of the Strait, on Mile, Mount Chappelle and Little Chalky Islands. The habitat of these later records is detailed. The status of the species, under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, is discussed and is recommended to be advanced from 'rare' to 'endangered'.

N2  - Abstract Specimens of the Heath Sand-skipper butterfly Antipodia chaostola were found from only three locations in a survey in Central Gippsland in 1998. Th e preferred larval food plant, Thatch Saw-sedge Gahnia radula, is common and widespread but the butterfly appears restricted to areas of Heathy Woodland, which is a very uncommon vegetation community generally occurring on gentle, north-facing lower slopes. Th e dominant eucalypt species are stringybarks and peppermints, which commonly are stunted and sparse due to the very infertile, yellowish, gradational soils. Female Heath Sand-skippers appear to favour small young plants or regrowth of Saw-sedge, following bushfires, for oviposition. As fire may be important or necessary for new growth of Sawsedge, it consequently may be important or necessary for the persistence of the Heath Sand-skipper. Using a 9-12 year fuel reduction burn cycle, and staggering the burning of patches of the habitat in a mosaic pattern, seem necessary to provide a constant availability of appropriate habitat for the Heath Sand-skipper.

N2  - Community attitudes toward urban possums in Victoria were examined. 500 questionnaires were sent to a random sample of residents from metropolitan Melbourne (n=103) as well as people who had had experiences with possums (n=340). Negative attitudes toward possums were found to exist in the community and these attitudes were not restricted to those who have had problems with possums. However, the extent of possum problems may be less than commonly believed, as over half of the respondents to newspaper stories calling for people with 'possum experiences' reported positive experiences with possums. Increasing media emphasis on positive experiences with possums and school-based education programs are identified as possible strategies for reducing conflicts and learning to live with possums in urban environments.

N2  - Automatic camera-traps were used to investigate the distribution of Mountain Brushtail Possum or Bobuck Trichosurus cunninghami in diverse habitats in south-west Gippsland, Victoria. Bobucks occur widely in lowland south-west Gippsland, with an apparent tendency to aggregate near the coast. Th ere appeared to be no association between bobucks and the presence or absence of Acacia spp. or with old-growth Eucalyptus spp. A new designation of the common names for the short-eared possum, Trichosurus caninus, and the mountain brushtail possum, Trichosurus cunninghami, to northern bobuck and southern bobuck, respectively, is proposed.

N2  - Exotic willows (Salix spp.) are widespread riparian tree species of rivers in temperate Australia and New Zealand. Despite being a Weed of National Significance, little is known about the novel habitats created by willows and the impact on aquatic biota of vegetation change following willow management programs. Reeds (Phragmites australis) and shrubs (Leptospermum spp. and Callistemon spp.) are common taxa in the riparian zone of Victorian streams and are considered suitable for planting along channels in revegetation programs following willow removal. Categorisation of macroinvertebrates into 'trophic' groups allows better understanding of the processes of energy flow, material cycle and stream ecosystem function. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups associated with willow, Phragmites australis, Leptospermum/Callistemon and bare bank habitats were examined in three central Victorian streams to gain insights to potential effects of willow removal on functional organisation of macroinvertebrates. There was a significant effect of habitat on macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups except collectors. Notable differences in functional feeding groups included a greater abundance of predators and grazers in Phragmites habitats and a greater abundance of shredders in willow habitats; however, these changes were variable during different seasons. It appears riparian vegetation change associated with willow management could bring about change of functional organisation of macroinvertebrates in these streams. This suggests that the vegetation changes can bring about changes in material cycle and energy flow within these streams.

N2  - Recent collections from a site in the Melbourne suburb of Altona North indicate that the truffle-like fungus Protubera canescens may be the young stage of the Cage Fungus Ileodictyon gracile. Over several months, fruit-bodies consistent with descriptions of Protubera canescens were observed, but later, at the same site, lattices emerged, typical of Ileodictyon gracile. In the unopened fruit-bodies radial threads were observed in the gelatinous layer of the peridium. These structures match with literature reports of the morphology of both species, although they have been little discussed previously in Ileodictyon gracile. Two other truffle-like species, Protubera africana and Rhizopogon rodwayi, have the radial threads and co-occur with Ileodictyon gracile. Thus, the possibility that they are also young stages of Ileodictyon should be explored. Development in Ileodictyon is unusual in combining the benefit of an enclosed, hypogeal truffle-like stage, where spore production is protected from desiccation, and an epigeal lattice-stage, from which spores are dispersed by insects.

N2  - Nature-based tourism targeting cetaceans is a billion dollar industry that continues to grow. Therefore, the ecological effects of this industry require investigation. Inshore marine wildlife, such as coastal populations of dolphins that have become tourism targets, is affected by human activities in the coastal zone, and tourism may be an additional stressor. The focus of marine wildlife tourism in southern Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia, is a coastal population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.). Commercial dolphin-swim and dolphin-watch operations seek out dolphins. This study monitored activity budgets of bottlenose dolphins at one site, in the presence and absence of vessels during a two-year period through land-based observations. The results demonstrate a significant decreased likelihood of bottlenose dolphins engaging in feeding behaviour when vessels were present. Schools with calves were significantly larger than groups without and vessel presence resulted in larger schools regardless of school composition. Results also indicated that the number of dolphins observed at the study site were lower during afternoon ebb tides and on afternoon slack tides. The significance of their reduced feeding in the long-term conservation of these dolphins will remain unclear until information is available on their behaviour in areas into which tourist operators do not venture.

N2  - Data and observations are given on the appearance, size, habits and diet of 163 Eastern Blue-tongued Skinks Tiliqua scincoides scincoides inhabiting the basalt plains grasslands to the north and west of Melbourne. Bluetongues possessed an average of seven dark body bands (5 - 9; n = 90) and seven dark tail bands (4 - 10; n = 79). Snout-to-vent lengths ranged from 76 to 340 mm (n = 108) and mass from 8 to 545 g (n = 68). Juveniles had relatively narrower heads compared to adults. Blue-tongues were active in all months of the year except winter. Surface stones were the main refugia available and were used by Blue-tongues throughout the year. Parturition occurred from February to April (n = 11). Blue-tongues fed on a variety of endemic and introduced fruits and arthropods. Based on the monthly variation of body sizes and a low number of recaptures, sexual maturity is probably not attained until at least two years of age.

N2  - This study suggested that long-term persistence of willow roots can provide a positive effect on aquatic communities until the new native vegetation cover establishes. Leaf type has no significant influence over taxa richness; however their availability and persistence in the system has a significant effect on macroinvertebrate abundance in these streams. A combination of 'Phragmites' reeds with 'Leptospermum' and 'Callistemon' shrubs in revegetation programs will ensure a persistent supply of leaf litter to macroinvertebrate communities in these streams thus should be retained until native canopy cover eg. 'Eucalyptus' spp. is re-established.

N2  - Weeds are one of the primary threats to biodiversity; however, their impacts on wildlife can vary. This research investigated the habitat value of Gorse 'Ulex europaeus' L. and Hawthorn 'Crataegus monogyna' Jacq. and the impacts of its removal on birds in a bushland park in Victoria. The area search method was used to survey birds in vegetation dominated by these two weeds, in native vegetation and in areas where a weed removal program was undertaken; this included revegetated areas. The highest bird species richness and abundance was found in sites dominated by the weeds. At sites where the weed removal program was in the early stages, a much lower species richness and abundance occurred. The final stage of the weed removal program, where revegetated areas were older than five years, supported high richness and abundance of birds, but not as high as that of sites dominated by the weeds; nor was the composition the same. Thus, even after five years, revegetation may not provide for the bird community that was originally supported by weeds. This is an important weed management consideration in this park, and should be for weed removal projects elsewhere.

N2  - Exotic flora, particularly weeds, are renowned for out-competing and displacing native flora, consequently affecting native fauna and pollinator relationships. Nonetheless, it stands to reason that weeds must provide some compensatory ecological value. This study assessed whether weeds are friend or foe to ecosystem function by considering the quality and quantity of pollen offered by widespread weeds in Australian ecosystems. Using the Honeybee 'Apis mellifera' as a case study, and information derived from highly experienced commercial apiarists, we determined that 32 exotic plants are important pollen sources. Most species offered high to very high quality pollen. Pollen quality varied temporally, spatially and infraspecifically. Fifteen species were considered more beneficial to 'A. mellifera' than others; only seven species were considered less beneficial. Thus, exotic flora contribute pollen resources that are valuable to maintain ecosystem function, particularly at times when flowering native species are few.

N2  - Bluebell Creeper 'Billardiera heterophylla' (Lindl.) L.Cayzer and Crisp (syn. 'Sollya heterophylla'), is a plant native to south-western Western Australia. Elsewhere in southern Australia, Bluebell Creeper is a highly invasive species and is a serious environmental weed in Victoria, Tasmania and the temperate regions of South Australia. The largest known infestation of the species occurs in the south-east of South Australia; however, this is only one of several recently discovered outbreaks in the vicinity of the state border in the lower south-east of South Australia and far south-western Victoria. The species is considered to be among the top priority environmental weed species for control in the region given what is known of its ecology, in particular its fecundity, capacity for disturbance-induced seed-bank regeneration and wide range of potential dispersal vectors. Bluebell Creeper is associated with a wide range of plant associations and is already well established at several discrete locations in the lower south-east of South Australia and the near-border zone of far south-western Victoria; however, its capacity for further spread is immense unless existing outbreaks are brought under control and simple measures to prevent new incursions are initiated. The known information on the species is collated and observations from a range of infestations with differing management histories, rainfall and edaphic characteristics are summarised. The implications of the species' ecology for best practice management are also discussed, as are future management and research recommendations.

Over time, the distribution of the adventive moss 'Pseudoscleropodium purum' in Victoria has expanded, and there is now evidence of it occurring in native vegetation. The capacity for growing a new plant from fragments requires care in managing disturbed, grassy areas where this moss grows.

N2  - Removal of European Rabbit 'Oryctolagus cuniculus' from Rabbit Island, Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, by 1968 resulted in increased vegetation, including an expanded shrubland, and was associated with increased Shorttailed Shearwater 'Ardenna tenuirostris' and Little Penguin 'Eudyptula minor' populations. Seabirds and vegetation were described in 1959, and since 1965 vegetation changes and birds present were noted on numerous visits. In one series of observations between 1965 and 1988, 13 non-passerine and 11 passerine species were reported. In another series made between 1986 and 1988, two other passerines and six additional non-passerines were seen; a further seven passerines and an additional 15 non-passerines (mostly in small numbers, oft en flying over the island) were recorded between 1991 and 2002. Raptor species were frequently seen, but some sightings of non-passerines (usually seen flying over or off the island) and most passerines were infrequent. Most birds recorded were dispersive, nomadic or migratory. Plant species also increased, from 24 (including four alien species) reported in 1959 to some 70 (including 14 alien species) found in recent visits. Nevertheless, changes in the island's simple floristics have not resulted in any substantial increase in species of breeding birds.

N2  - Prolonged drought, as has been experienced over much of the wheat-sheep (or grassy woodland) zone of southern New South Wales during approximately the last 15 years, is equivalent to a change in climatic zone from subhumid to semi-arid. One of the symptoms of this is less reliable rainfall, particularly during the normally dependable autumn-winter period. As demonstrated by the results of a 7-year experiment in a grassland near Molong in Central Western NSW, this change, if permanent rather than temporary, has implications for ecological experiments that aim to change botanic composition using various manipulatory techniques. At Molong, significant differences in botanic composition were evident over time but not between treatments. It is suggested that this result can be explained by the prevailing rainfall regime during the period of observation and that different results may have been obtained if rainfall had been more closely aligned to the long-term average.

N2  - A once-off pilot study was conducted in north-eastern Victoria to assess the spiders associated with two agricultural landscapes (a vineyard and a grazing property). The study found a total of 225 individual spiders from 19 families. No significant differences were found in the number of families of spiders or total spider abundance between the paddocks and adjacent shelterbelts. However, it is suggested that more sampling on several seasonal occasions may reveal differences because preliminary results indicate that certain spider families have preferences for particular habitat factors (such as the availability of vegetation on which to build webs, or the openness of the ground layer).

N2  - Of 124 Platypus mortality records from the 1980s to 2009 where the cause of death could be reliably assigned, 41% were deemed to be due to animals drowning in nets or traps set to capture fish or freshwater crustaceans, with fyke nets and opera house traps mainly responsible for Platypus deaths since 2000. By comparison, 26% of mortality records were ascribed to natural causes (predation by raptors and canids, flooding and drought), though natural causes were almost certainly under-reported. Other important factors contributing to mortality included litter and fishing hooks (14% of mortality records), man-made structures such as irrigation gates and pumps (10%) and motor vehicles (4%).

N2  - Germination characteristics of seven indigenous grassland species from the Victorian (Western) Basalt Plains (Austrodanthonia racemosa, Bulbine bulbosa, Chrysocephalum apiculatum, Leptorhynchos squamatus, Leucochrysum albicans ssp. albicans var. tricolor, Linum marginale, Wahlenbergia stricta) were investigated prior to their use in a seeding program. Germination tests at 20degree/10degreeC and 12hr/12 hr light/dark showed a range of maximum germination responses from 21% (W. stricta) to 83% (A. racemosa). Two trends were observed in terms of speed of germination. Austrodanthonia racemosa, Chrysocephalum apiculatum and Linum marginale germinated rapidly (t50 < 7 and 14 days) and Bulbine bulbosa, Leptorhynchos squamatus, Leucochrysum albicans ssp. albicans var. tricolor and Wahlenbergia stricta exhibited a slower germination response (t50 between 20 and 30 days). When seeds of each species were exposed to smoke product, cool stratification and smoke cool + stratification, Linum marginale was the only species to respond with significantly higher germination (smoke application). Further testing of smoke product at recommended and higher rates produced a range of speciesspecific dose responses, both positive and negative. These findings confirmed considerable species-specific variations in responses, and differences/similarities of responses between ours and other studies. Therefore, to most accurately gauge seed-lot characteristics, it is recommended that species are routinely tested prior to their use in grassland restoration programs.

N2  - Urbanisation is increasing rapidly, impacting on a broad range of species. The proliferation of electric light has transformed the night time environment; however, our understanding on the effects of artificial night lighting on fauna, including nocturnal birds, is extremely limited. The aim of this research was to determine whether artificial night light affected the abundance of nocturnal birds. Spotlighting surveys were undertaken in Research Park, Melbourne, Victoria, along three 300 m transects. Each transect was surveyed five times during three light treatments: when lights were on, 20 minutes after lights were turned off and when lights were absent, over a period of ten nights. A total of 123 nocturnal birds was detected during survey nights. Two species were recorded - the Southern Boobook 'Ninox novaeseelandiae' and the Tawny Frogmouth 'Podargus strigoides'. The Tawny Frogmouth was detected along all three transects (n=121); however, the Southern Boobook was detected along one transect only (n=2). None of the light treatments had a significant effect on bird abundance. Neither did location, habitat or the combined effects of light treatments, location and habitat. The results of this research will contribute to a growing body of knowledge and support future conservation activities for species in areas undergoing urbanisation.

N2  - In recent years episodes of storm damage to the sea wall at Black Rock have occurred in April and May, when the adjacent sandy beach has disappeared because of northward longshore drifting during the previous summer. Southward drifting from April to November then restores a protective beach in front of the sea wall. Damage is likely to recur in April and May unless a beach can be artificially maintained in front of the sea wall.

N2  - A frog survey was undertaken in Churchill National and the adjacent Lysterfield State Park in the 12 months beginning May 2008. Frogs were identified by their advertisement calls. Nine species were identified including the state significant Southern Toadlet Pseudophryne semimarmorata. The Parks therefore provide habitat for the majority of frogs with known distributions in the region. The survey was undertaken in a period of below average rainfall and a follow-up visit aft er a heavy rainfall event demonstrated how rainfall is critical to results, when using this survey technique. The follow-up visit found six species at sites where they had not been previously recorded, including one species heard at five additional sites. Th e survey provided evidence of the suitability of artificial wetlands for frogs. Th e results showed the need for a survey relying on advertisement calls to cover an annual cycle given the seasonality of frog mating activity.

N2  - This study investigated the burrow morphology of the mud shrimp, 'Laomedia healyi' Yaldwyn and Wear, in stands of mangrove in Western Port Bay, Victoria. Burrow structure was described from resin casts. L. healyi burrows extended further horizontally than vertically and burrows were constructed around the pneumato-phores that densely penetrate the sediment at the base of the mangrove trees. Burrows had multiple surface openings, several of which were circular and constricted and others that were oval shaped, connected to a single vertical or sloping main tunnel. The tunnels had a sub-circular cross section with smooth floors and rough walls and roofs and tunnel diameters were considerably larger than the inhabitant. Bulbous terminal chambers were present but did not contain plant material. The characteristic features of L. healyi burrows indicate that the species is most likely a deposit feeder.

N2  - The Swamp Helmet-orchid 'Corybas fordhamii' (Rupp) Rupp was collected in a southern gully of the Darling Range on Flinders Island in September 1972 when about 45 plants were noted. The species had not been recorded in Tasmania previously. It was found again in early May 2005 when just two leaves were noticed, although 142 plants were found when the site was visited in late August and early September of the same year. The gully was visited five times in September 2009 when 102 orchids were found. Most plants were upstream or downstream of the localities of 2005. The vegetation of the all sites is described below but the exact locality is not given as the orchid is scheduled as endangered under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The records, and two potential threats, are discussed.

N2  - The Werribee River catchment, north and west of Melbourne, has experienced major change since European settlement, including the transformation or loss of native vegetation through agriculture and urbanisation. These changes are likely to have influenced the original frog fauna, although this cannot be confirmed since no broad-scale monitoring of the frog fauna in the catchment has been undertaken. Like all of Victoria's catchment areas, the main inventory of the frog fauna in the Werribee River catchment is the Victorian Government's Atlas of Victorian Wildlife database. Reliable records exist for 11 frog species in the Werribee River catchment, some dating back to 1959. Importantly, there are records for two species, Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis and Bibron's Toadlet Pseudophryne bibronii, which are officially threatened in Victoria. Species recorded from the catchment display a variety of ecological preferences (e.g. riverine specialists, semiterrestrial breeders, burrowers, and wetland or slow-flowing river species), highlighting the importance of conserving and managing appropriately varied and interconnected habitats. In this paper, the Werribee River Catchment, a typical and recognised management unit, is used as a case study to examine the utility of available data for the management of frogs, and summarise the likely existing threats to this assemblage.

N2  - Overbank flooding of rivers is a key process in the maintenance of vegetation types and the species that rely on the floodplain forests and woodlands of northern Victoria. Yet the flooding requirements of species and vegetation types are poorly known. Here we present initial estimates of the water requirements for flood-dependent Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs) and rare and threatened flora and fauna species associated with the floodplain of the Murray River and its tributaries. Some 110 EVCs were found to be at least partly flood-dependent on the Murray River floodplains. The total current extent of these EVCs in the study area is 224 247 ha, of which 162 266 ha are on public land. One hundred and twenty-four rare or threatened plant taxa and 62 threatened vertebrate fauna taxa (excluding fish) were classified as at least partly flood-dependent. These initial estimates provide important information for land and water managers and researchers alike.

N2  - This paper reports observations of a single Jacky Lizard Amphibolurus muricatus (Agamidae) preying upon Banded Bees Amegilla sp. (Apidae) as they flew near their nesting aggregation in bushland of northern Sydney, NSW, Australia. The foraging behaviour of this wild A. muricatus individual may have been somewhat more complex than that previously reported for captive individuals of this species. Bees may constitute only a minor proportion of the diet of A. muricatus in the wild and lizards may be less effective predators upon nesting bees than birds.

N2  - The Pilliga Scrub is a large semi-arid woodland area in northern inland New South Wales with limited freshwater habitats and a frequent scarcity of surface water. A survey of the area's decapod crustacean fauna in 2009-2010 identified five species: the crayfish Cherax destructor (Parastacidae), crab Austrothelphusa transversa (Parathelphusidae), shrimps Caridina mccullochi and Paratya australiensis (Atyidae) and prawn Macrobrachium australiense (Palaemonidae). The decapod diversity is low at the species level but relatively high at the family level, and reflects the location of the Pilliga Scrub in a transitional zone between faunal assemblages of southern and northern Australia. Cherax destructor and Austrothelphusa transversa are well suited to the variable aquatic conditions in the Pilliga Scrub and can survive prolonged drought in burrows. Caridina mccullochi, Paratya australiensis and Macrobrachium australiense, in contrast, are dependent on surface water at all life cycle stages, and their survival in the Pilliga Scrub relies on the few small permanent waterholes along larger intermittent streams or, if these dry out, re-colonisation from downstream perennial river channels during occasional stream flow events. An increase in aridity due to anthropogenic climate change could result in the local extinction of these three species, representing a 60% reduction in local decapod species diversity.

N2  - A yellow to olive-yellow Pluteus species (Fungi, Agaricales) has been observed on a number of Field Naturalists Club of Victoria Fungi Group forays. It was thought to be P. lutescens based on images found in some fungi field guides. Detailed examination of the pileus cuticle (pileipellis) revealed a cutis in transition to a trichoderm with long cylindrical terminal cells. This is inconsistent with P. lutescens, which has a hymenoderm layer of almost spherical inflated cells. The characteristics of this Pluteus were compared with a number of other species, namely P. pauperculus (= P. lutescens sensu K. Griffiths), P. romellii, P. chrysophlebius and the species in Pluteus stirps Leoninus for which our species seemed to have an affinity. It was concluded that the characteristics did not match any of the species examined, which would suggest that this species is undescribed.

N2  - Th e stomach flushing technique is a vital tool in bird dietary studies. Th e technique requires a tube to be inserted into the penguin's mouth and passed through the oesophagus to the stomach. General practice does not include cleaning of the tube between penguins. Th is report investigates if the stomach flushing tube can be a vehicle to transmit potential pathogens from a sick penguin to a healthy penguin, and if implementation of aseptic or disinfection practice is warranted in the stomach flushing technique. A total of 19 tubes from 19 penguins were examined for bacterial presence from May until August 2007. Th is paper presents new recommendations for stomach flushing procedures from a microbial perspective to ensure that birds subjected to this are not jeopardised by practices that may promote the transfer of potential pathogens from one penguin to another.

N2  - Venomous snakes destroy their prey by poison. Some, such as the Copper-headed, when they have caught and bitten an animal, commence swallowing it at once, while yet alive, but the Tiger Snake does not touch its prey after it has bitten it until life is quite extinct. When swallowing, the jaws are moved alternately. Th is is possible from the freedom of movement which is obtained by all the bones of the head being united by elastic ligaments, so that the head and jaws can stretch considerably. Hence also snakes can swallow prey apparently larger than themselves. Occasionally two snakes will seize upon the same prey, and as neither will give way, the larger swallows the lesser, until the latter is compelled to relax its hold on the prey and withdraw from the contest. I lately heard of a case where a large snake had swallowed a smaller one in the manner described, but the latter had gone too far down to be able to recede, and died, and when the larger snake was opened, it was found to have partially digested its opponent, only the tail remaining uninjured. The Tiger Snakes and Death-adders generally prefer mice and rats. Rats do not succumb readily to the poison, and take a long time to die. Lately I saw a small native cat bitten severely by three large Tiger Snakes, with about five minutes' interval between each bite, and it took an hour and a half to die. The other snakes prefer frogs as an article of diet...

The basin, some 200m long and approximately 80m across at its widest point, is always interesting to visit, and this time I was about to see something special.

N2  - The Red-necked Wallaby Macropus rufogriseus is generally seen in woodlands where there is shrub cover, or on the fringes of forests. Th e species was thought to be substantially affected by past rabbit poisoning practices in woodlands and bushland reserves. It also appeared to be less common in its former haunts following the advent in the 1980s of the Black Wallaby Wallabia bicolor, which now occupies habitats from rocky ranges to wetland fringes or beach frontage. Visitors to Griffith Island at Port Fairy often see this species browsing on the introduced Shiny Leaf Coprosma repens, even wading in a pool to reach a favoured shrub.

N2  - In 2008 I had an article published in The Victorian Naturalist that explored the question: Are kangaroos indigenous to Wilsons Promontory National Park? (Whelan 2008). Nearly all available evidence led to the conclusion that they were not but there was one record that indicated kangaroos were present in the early part of the 19th century. This record was an article in the Medical Journal of Australia (Bird 1926) that recounted a walking expedition undertaken by Fred Bird in 1879. In his account of the expedition, Bird remarked on the presence of kangaroos around the Yanakie Homestead near the current park entrance.

N2  - A recent article by McFadden et al. (2010) describing the occurrence of a curious toetwitching behaviour in the Corroboree Frog Pseudophryne corroboree has prompted me to report observations I had made of an apparently similar behaviour in Sudell's Frog Neobatrachus sudelli 26 years ago. At the time the observations were made I could find no reference to this behaviour in the literature on Australian frogs and considered it to be an involuntary pre-feeding response of little importance. Reports of the occurrence of toe-twitching in frogs are not new (Murphy 1976, Radcliffe et al. 1986, Bertoluci 2002, Grafe 2008) but a recent literature review documented its occurrence in a small number of frog and toad species from a broad range of families, suggesting that it is potentially widespread within the Amphibia (Sloggett and Zeilstra 2008). To date the behaviour appears to have been reported in only two Australian frog species Pseudophryne bibroni and P. corroboree (McFadden et al. 2010) and its functional significance remains unclear, although this has been rigorously tested in only one species (the Cane Toad Rhinella marinus, formerly Bufo marinus; Hagman and Shine 2008). I describe the circumstances of occurrence and the nature of toe-twitching behaviour in juvenile N. sudelli.

N2  - Although of immense local interest and encompassing a wide diversity in itself, the subject of the 2010 FNCV Biodiversity Symposium is not one that has been well covered in previous volumes of this journal. Readers of The Victorian Naturalist would need to go back to issues published almost 60 years ago to find a collection of papers on the natural history of Melbourne (Anon 1942a, b; Colliver 1942; Fostick 1942; Mitchell 1942). There have been many individual papers published in this journal on a wide variety of aspects of the topic but only one such collection. The present issue is the first that is dedicated entirely to Melbourne's natural history.

N2  - Urbanisation is currently impacting frog and reptile species worldwide through the loss of native habitats. Broad changes in the distribution and abundance of frog and reptile species in the Melbourne area were assessed from 1850-2006 using historical sources and wildlife databases. A total of six species of frogs (out of 16 species) and 26 species of reptiles (out of 39 species) were recorded in fewer Local Government Areas from 1990 to 2006 than from 1850 to 1989. These results suggest that there have been substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of species, particularly reptiles. Several species are on the edge of their natural distribution in the Melbourne area, which may confound assessments of the impact of urbanisation. Preserving habitat remnants on the urban fringe is likely to be the most effective means of conserving extant species. Establishing long-term monitoring programs of frogs and reptiles in the Melbourne area is recommended. (The Victorian Naturalist 128 (5) 2011, 162-173).

N2  - The native vegetation of the Melbourne region was heavily diminished in extent and composition by the turn of the 20th century. An account is given of the trends that have occurred, particularly over the past century. Clearing for agriculture began as a major cause of loss of native vegetation, ultimately overtaken by urban development. Remnants have been changed progressively by tree removal, naturalisation of non-indigenous species, grazing by stock, drainage works, altered fire regimes and ancillary effects. Substantial declines of some indigenous plant species during the record drought of 1997-2010 indicate what may be in store with future climate change. Red List assessments of the risk of local extinction of plant species are summarised for three Melbourne municipalities. Concerted intervention will probably be needed to avoid many local extinctions over the next decade or so. The assessments also reveal the nature of the threats faced and hence guide determination of measures that may avert them. (The Victorian Naturalist 128 (5) 2011, 175-181).

N2  - Numerous fungi are found in greater Melbourne due to the variety of substrates available in parks and gardens and in remnant native vegetation. Specimen and sight record data on the 866 fungi known from Melbourne are summarised. In the National Herbarium of Victoria there are 2501 collections of fungi from greater Melbourne representing 549 non-lichenised and 269 lichenised species. In the Fungimap database, there are 2664 records of 155 species, including 48 species not represented in the National Herbarium. Examples of common species are tabulated. Fungi associated with particular substrates or habitats are summarised, including those on dead wood and litter and in lawns as well as ectomycorrhizal partners of exotic and native trees. Remnant native vegetation harbours considerable fungal diversity. Important questions remain to be answered about factors affecting the occurrence of fungi and the potential effects of climate change. New tools from the Atlas of Living Australia will assist in compiling and analysing data, and molecular data has the potential to expedite species identification. Melbourne is an excellent locale to study fungi due to its concentration of naturalists in combination with a variety of habitats suitable for fungi. (The Victorian Naturalist 128 (5) 2011, 183-197).

N2  - The most diverse group of animals in the greater Melbourne region is the invertebrates. They are essential in maintaining many ecological functions in the varied environments across the area. Yet we lack basic information on the identity, distribution and biology for most species. Historical information and collections are important in understanding the fauna of Melbourne, but the environment is always changing and the different species of invertebrates can adapt to these changes. This has resulted in a Melbourne invertebrate fauna comprising native species that have always resided in the region, and invertebrates that have been introduced since European settlement either from overseas or from other parts of Australia. Despite the lack of information about the fauna at the time of European settlement, invertebrates are still a rich resource for studying and understanding the nature of Melbourne.

N2  - The bird fauna of Melbourne has changed in many ways since the 19th century, and this paper documents some of these changes using Keartland's paper as a benchmark for the 19th century, along with our own experience for recent decades. Woodland birds declined substantially as woodlands were cleared in the 19th century, and several species became locally extinct. Farmland birds prospered and then declined as farmland was converted to housing. Some forest birds colonised gardens and parks as trees and shrubs matured through the 20th century. Planting of native shrubs has benefited some species such as Little Wattlebird, and complex competitive interactions between aggressive honeyeaters and other birds are involved in shaping the bird fauna and the ecosystem. Climate variability has played a role, with droughts encouraging waves of immigration. In recent decades there have been spectacular waves of colonising species from inland Australia (Galah, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Little Corella and Crested Pigeon), the eastern seaboard (Rainbow Lorikeet) and the western plains (Long-billed Corella). Introduced European birds declined substantially during the 1997-2010 drought. Conservation of native vegetation has been the main factor contributing to the high diversity still represented in Melbourne's bird fauna. (The Victorian Naturalist 128 (5) 2011, 210-231).

N2  - We collated and analysed records of mammal species (native and introduced) from across 32 Local Government Areas that comprise the Greater Melbourne region. Records of each species were examined for temporal changes in presence or absence. The region has a particularly diverse mammalian fauna with records of 92 species, including 19 marine mammals that have been recorded in Port Phillip. This total represents 65% of Victoria's mammalian fauna. About one-third of the 51 native terrestrial species have undergone a demonstrable decline in the region, to the point where their future presence is in doubt. Five species are no longer found in the region and the status of another three is uncertain. In contrast, up to five native terrestrial species are thought to have increased in abundance in recent decades, including the spectacular colonisation of the city by the Grey-headed Flying-fox as a year-round resident.

N2  - The Spotted Pardalote Pardalotus punctatus is one of Australia's smallest birds: it is about 95 mm long and weighs only 9 g. Its usual habitat is eucalypt forests and woodlands, where it feeds in the treetops but, especially during autumn and winter, it also ventures into suburban areas where eucalypts abound. Its food consists mainly of arthropods, particularly psyllid larvae and lerp, but also manna from eucalypts. It is monogamous for at least one breeding season, and breeds from June to January (occasionally as late as March), sometimes raising as many as three broods in a season. The nest is usually in a chamber at the end of a tunnel in an earth bank, though other sites such as tree hollows are also used. The nest is made of strips of bark, grass and other plant materials, with an entrance generally in line with the tunnel. Usually four white eggs are laid, and the incubation period varies from 16 to 22 days. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs (Higgins and Peter 2002).

N2  - The Victorian fires in February 2009 burnt habitat once occupied by the nationally threatened Alpine Tree Frog Litoria verreauxii alpina. During November 2009 day and night frog surveys were conducted at Lake Mountain and nearby Mount Bullfight Nature Conservation Reserve. Despite historical records, Alpine Tree Frogs were not recorded at Lake Mountain, but were discovered at Mount Bullfight which was surveyed for frogs for the first time. The apparent absence of Alpine Tree Frogs from Lake Mountain pre-dates the fire according to prior observations of decline and probable disappearance. The persistence of the subspecies on Mount Bullfight may be related to this site's remoteness and resultant lack of exposure to Amphibian Chytrid Fungus. We detected the fungus at Lake Mountain but not at Mount Bullfight. Preventing the introduction of Amphibian Chytrid Fungus to Mount Bullfight is likely to be crucial in retaining its current frog diversity. (The Victorian Naturalist 128(6) 2011, 260-265).

N2  - Nineteen species of land slaters (Isopoda: Oniscoidea), two of which are exotics, are recorded for Tasmanian islands of Banks and eastern Bass Straits. Specimens were obtained from 37 of the 100 visited islands. Six of the native species have been found only on the eastern islands to date. One taxon is known from just Deal Island and Wilsons Promontory. Another is known with certainty from two islands and there is a possible record of it for Wilsons Promontory. Two slaters, formerly thought to be Tasmanian endemics, are recorded for the first time on the Australian mainland, at Wilsons Promontory. Comments are made on the habitat of some of the species, and the range and extent of the collecting. The distribution of several species, and their probable origins, are discussed. A table of the known distribution of the 19 taxa is presented. (The Victorian Naturalist 128 (6), 2011, 266-271).

N2  - The Southern Barred Frog Mixophyes balbus is a large frog (to 80 mm) that historically occurred along the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, extending from East Gippsland in Victoria to north-eastern New South Wales (DSEWPC 2011; DSE 2009a; NSW DECCW 2005). This species has undergone widespread decline across much of its former range (Mahony 1993; Tyler 1997), particularly in the southern portion, where it has been recorded at only three localities south of Sydney in the last 10 years (Daly et al. 2000; White 2000; Hunter 2001, cited in Gillespie 2011). This species is classified as Vulnerable under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (FFG Act) and classified as Critically Endangered in Victoria (DSE 2007).

N2  - Change is a constant factor in the life of all species; something that often cannot be controlled but must be adapted to. Unfortunately, the extent and speed of change often do not allow for easy adaptation, and species are becoming extinct. For example, the processes of urbanisation, a major source of change for many native species, are ever increasing. It is predicted that by 2025 more than 60% of the human population will reside in urban settlements.

N2  - Annual plants are an under-studied component of the Victorian flora. We describe the morphology and seed biology of ten species common to semi-arid woodlands in far western Victoria: Actinobole uliginosum, Blennospora drummondii, Calandrinia granulifera, Centrolepis strigosa, Millotia tenuifolia, Podotheca angustifolia, Pogonolepis muelleriana, Quinetia urvillei, Rhodanthe pygmaea, Triptilodiscus pygmaeus. Two forms of growth morphology were observed - 'erect' and 'branched'. Three species were found to have myxospermous seeds. Here, the seed coat contains a mass of dry mucilage which hydrates and swells rapidly on contact with water. Eight species appear to have dormant seed at the time of dispersal, presumably a strategy to avoid germination in summer. This dormancy was overcome when seed was heated to 35 degreesC for 4 weeks. Our preliminary studies confirm that annuals are a fascinating group of plants which warrant much better ecological understanding. Further quantitative investigation of the seed biology (particularly the extent and role of myxospermy), seed germination requirements (including dormancy-breaking mechanisms) and developmental anatomy are clearly necessary.

Further surveys were conducted at both locations by RMIT University between 2003 and 2010, resulting in additional records of mammals and reptiles including several rare and threatened species. These included Southern Brown Bandicoot Isoodon obesulus, Heath Mouse Pseudomys shortridgei, Swamp Skink Lissolepis coventryi, Mountain Dragon Rankinia diemensis and Fat-tailed Dunnart Sminthopsis crassicaudata. Significant numbers of Southern Brown Bandicoot were captured at one study site in the Grampians that had been subjected to fox-baiting. Several new locality records were obtained for reptiles including Ragged Snake-eyed Skink Cryptoblepharus pannosus, Southern Grass Skink Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii, Eastern Three-lined Skink Bassiana duperreyi, Coventry's Skink Niveoscincus coventryi and the plain-back colour morph of White's Skink Liopholis whitii.

N2  - Field data and observations on the natural history of the Tussock Skink Pseudemoia pagenstecheri inhabiting the basalt plains grasslands near Melbourne are described based on the capture of 141 of these lizards and approximately 70 sightings. Mature females were larger and heavier than males and the adult sex ratio was 1:1. There was a strong linear correlation between snout-to-vent length (SVL) and both tail length and head length; the natural logarithm of both SVL and mass were also strongly correlated. Skinks were active in all months of the year when conditions were favourable and they used primarily stones and grass tussocks as both refugia and basking sites. They tended to occur singly, both when active and sheltering. Parturition occurred in December and January. Small elapid snakes were found to prey on P. pagenstecheri of all sizes.

N2  - A recent 'desk-top survey' of information available on several non-aquatic invertebrate groups (molluscs, butterflies and moths, ants, bees and jewel beetles) including taxa of conservation interest in Victoria is summarised. The paucity of information on many taxa renders sound assessment of conservation status based on abundance, distribution, ecological knowledge and vulnerability very subjective, and, in many cases, largely dependent on the opinion of individual workers. In a few cases, precise identification of taxa cannot be confirmed. The limitations of existing information are discussed, together with ways to improve the framework knowledge of invertebrates to enhance their incorporation into wider conservation agendas within the State.

N2  - Targeted surveys for the threatened Golden sun moth Synemon plana (Lepidoptera: Castniidae) (GSM) were conducted across the Victorian Volcanic Plains in the summers of 2009 and 2010 in order to address the lack of information for this moth in this bioregion. We aimed to locate new populations and accumulate further ecological information for the moth. New populations were recorded at 46 sites overall, many of which were located in the west of the Victorian Volcanic Plains, presumably because of more intensive survey effort there. Survey returns differed between years, most likely as a consequence of different weather conditions. The GSM was generally located at sites dominated by native grasses, and was significantly positively correlated with wallaby grasses Rytidosperma spp. Both the habitat of GSM and the weather conditions under which the moth is active may not be as strictly defined as previously thought.

N2  - A revised list of the butterflies of the La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent nature conservation reserves near Melbourne is presented based on intermittent observations and collections between 1989 and 2011. A total of 31 species is recorded, of which 22 (71%) are considered to be resident. Of the resident species, nine (41%) specialise as larvae on Poaceae. Populations of three resident species that were previously absent have become established via different pathways: Trapezites symmomus was translocated deliberately in 1988, Trapezites phigalioides appears to have been introduced unintentionally in the late 1990s, while Toxidia doubledayi invaded the area naturally during a period of range expansion during the 1990s. The introduction of the hesperiid Trapezites symmomus involved several key elements, namely community education in relation to the principles of butterfly conservation, involvement of local science students and park rangers, increasing the extent and integrity of the butterflies' habitat through collection and propagation of the larval food plant, translocation of the larval stage of the butterfly, and long-term monitoring of the species over 20+ years. Ecological restoration and conservation management of the reserves estate over the past two decades appears to have benefited the grass- and Lomandra-feeding specialists and other butterflies associated with the understorey ground layer. The success of the T. symmomus introduction suggests that other more threatened species in the Melbourne area associated with monocot food plants could potentially be established in conservation reserves through such translocation programs.

N2  - The environmental effect on seagrass of sediment plumes from dredging is often questioned in Environmental Impact Statements. Seagrass in southern Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia, was shaded in winter and spring to the same level as the worst scenario of shading by an expected dredge plume. After 90 days of shading, Heterozostera nigricaulis shoot numbers reduced by 61%. After 134 days of shading, the shoot density reduced by 84%. Some of the shades were removed after 71 days of shading, but shoot density continued to decline for a further 40 days in these plots, and no recovery was observed throughout this time. In these plots, where shades had been removed, shoot densities then stabilised and no further loss was reported at day 134. A minimum light requirement of 12.5%-25.6% appears to be suitable for sustaining H. nigricaulis beds. (The Victorian Naturalist 129 (3), 2012, 97-108).

N2  - Artificial refuges can be used to determine the presence of terrestrial fauna and to replace or enhance lost or degraded natural habitat. Concrete pavers, roof tiles, sheets of galvanised iron and old fence posts were used at three sites in southern and western Victoria to determine the presence of small terrestrial vertebrates and to provide artificial habitat. Twenty species were recorded comprising two mammals, 12 reptiles and six amphibians. Fat-tailed Dunnart Sminthopsis crassicaudata was recorded on eight occasions using roof tiles in a lightly grazed, grassland site on the Victorian Volcanic Plain. Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis was found under old fence posts beside a restored wetland. Little Whip Snake Parasuta flagellum was recorded under artificial refuges from areas with thick grass or tussock cover. Spotted Marsh Frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis was found in large numbers under all forms of artificial habitat. Concrete pavers and old fence posts returned the highest diversity of species and the greatest number of individuals. The usefulness of artificial terrestrial habitat as a survey method is compared with other survey methods. The value of artificial habitat as a management tool and associated problems are discussed.

N2  - Norman Wakefield wrote two papers published in The Victorian Naturalist in 1960 that examined four subfossil deposits from caves in the Buchan district, East Gippsland, Victoria. Wakefield suggested that Eastern Quolls Dasyurus viverrinus were responsible for their accumulation in two caves, M-27 and M-28 (cave tag numbers). There is, however, limited evidence to support Wakefield's conclusion. Instead, there is convincing evidence that the Sooty Owl Tyto tenebricosa was responsible. This is based on the structural integrity of the sub-fossil bones, apparent digestive erosion on bones (indicating partial digestion and regurgitation by owls), characteristics of the caves, location of sub-fossils, surrounding habitat, body size-range of mammals within the sub-fossil deposits and known feeding ecology of all owl species. This is an important finding because analysis of the prehistoric and contemporary Sooty Owl diet can provide valuable information for our understanding of the small mammal palaeocommunity, recent declines and mammal conservation.

N2  - An act of vandalism in August 2010 seriously damaged the historically significant native River Red Gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis, known as the Separation Tree, located within Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. The vicinity of this tree was one place for the 1850 celebrations of the news that Victoria was to become a separate colony from New South Wales in 1851. The Separation Tree was placed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust of Victoria in 1982. In view of the age of the Separation Tree (estimated at about 350 years in 1950), possible future 'replacement' River Red Gum trees were planted nearby in 1951 and 2001, and are growing vigorously. The age of the Separation Tree is currently estimated at about 400 years, although this paper, based on expected diameter growth, suggests that it could be as young as about 260 years. The health of the Separation Tree, according to reports, has waxed and waned up to the present. Despite the ringbarking, this veteran tree currently has a healthy crown and, due to the re-establishment of remnant bark tissue and bridgegrafting, may continue to live for many years yet.

N2  - The historical range of Trout Cod Maccullochella macquariensis (Cuvier, 1829) is thought to have included much of the southern Murray-Darling Basin (Lintermans 2007; Trueman 2007). Severe reductions in both abundance and distribution have led to the conservation status of the species being listed as 'Endangered' (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988). By the 1980s Trout Cod was restricted to only one, viable, naturally occurring population, located in the Murray River between Yarrawonga and Tocumwal (Berra 1974; Cadwallader et al. 1984; Ingram et al. 1990). The present distribution of this Trout Cod population is now reported to have increased and includes the Murray River (and anabranches) from Yarrawonga to around Barmah (TCRT 2008; Lintermans 2007).

A description of the fungus is given, which represents the first record of the species from Australia. Significant variation in the appearance of the fruit-bodies was observed between occurrences in different years, possibly because of different weather conditions. The antibiotic properties of this species could have important implications for Australian environments. (The Victorian Naturalist 129 (5) 2012, 160-166)

N2  - The aesthetic value of trees in the avenues, boulevards, parks and gardens of Australian cities is often widely appreciated, but their economic value is often under-valued. Trees provide services and fulfil functional roles in cities. They are significant components of urban infrastructure and have a real and calculable economic value. An urban forest of 100 000 trees can save $1million per annum because their shade reduces electricity consumption. Shade can prolong the life of tarmac, and carbon is sequestered as the trees grow. A single large tree growing in a school may provide the equivalent shade of four shade sails, returning a value of about $2000 per annum, while five trees can stabilise a steep suburban block which would otherwise require about $50 000 of engineered piling to secure building insurance. Calculation of the economic contributions of trees can change the economic algorithms upon which decisions are made in cities. (The Victorian Naturalist 129 (5) 2012, 167-174) 0

N2  - As part of its 'Fighting Extinction' program, Zoos Victoria has developed criteria to guide when it will initiate captive-breeding programs for native threatened species. Application of these criteria, which are based on extinction risk, has resulted in the identification of twenty priority threatened species for ex situ conservation. This list includes the genetically-distinct lowland population of Leadbeater's Possum. As a result, a captive-breeding program has been initiated to prevent the extinction of this population. The 'Fighting Extinction' strategy represents a more structured, systematic and integrated approach to how Zoos Victoria is attempting to deliver tangible conservation outcomes. Notably, measures of success are tied to the condition of wild populations. Aspects of the 'Fighting Extinction' strategy and the Leadbeater's Possum captive-breeding program are described.

N2  - Forest communities typically are defined by their floristic composition and structure. This data is collected using quadrat based surveys and analysed statistically using a nearest neighbour algorithm. Tens of thousands of such quadrats have been collected across Victoria and this data has been used to identify numerous vegetation communities known as ecological vegetation classes (EVCs). While EVCs are locally based on floristics they are more broadly defined by a consistent set of physical and climatic parameters such as rainfall, aspect and soil conditions. Wet Forest in East Gippsland therefore may have quite different floristics from those in the Otway Ranges, but as they occur under similar environmental conditions, support similar life-forms and have similar structural characteristics they are identified as the same EVC.

N2  - Mainland Australia's five natural snow-fed alpine lakes that regularly freeze over the winter are located in the Snowy Mountains (36 degrees 25'S). Ice formation on these lakes usually occurs in June, close to the winter solstice, and the date of ice break-up is usually in October (Green 2011). Over the past decade the extent and thickness of ice on Blue Lake has been measured in early to mid-September. Layering in the ice was documented as overlaying snow, hard ice layers and slush layers, and monitoring of the ice cover was continued until ice break-up. Highly conspicuous red colouration on the ice cover was observed in October 2002, 2003 and 2004 but (for various reasons such as ice breakout in September 2006, heavy October snowfalls obscuring the lake ice surface in 2009) no colouration was seen between 2005 and 2010 (Table 1). Red colouration was seen in November 2003, when the ice lasted until then, but was never seen in September. Samples were collected in October and November 2003 and were preserved in gluteraldehyde for examination with a scanning electron microscope at the Australian Antarctic Division.

N2  - Wildfire is a common occurrence in south-eastern Australia affecting fauna populations in various ways. Data were collected at a site near Moyston in western Victoria on three occasions before and five occasions after wildfire. Seventeen mammal species were recorded pre-wildfire whilst 23 species were recorded post-wildfire. The diversity of insectivorous bats was not affected by the wildfire, maybe because a number of mature River Red Gums Eucalyptus camaldulensis with numerous suitable roosting hollows survived the wildfire. Populations of Sugar Glider Petaurus breviceps, Common Brushtail Possum Trichosurus vulpecula and Common Ringtail Possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus also survived the fire in an area of mature River Red Gums. A small population of Swamp Rat Rattus lutreolus survived the fire and successfully recolonised regenerating habitat. Yellow-footed Antechinus Antechinus flavipes and Eastern Pygmy Possum Cercartetus nanus were recorded in regenerating Heathy Woodland after wildfire severely burnt this vegetation. The population of Black Wallaby Wallabia bicolor increased three years after wildfire as regenerating vegetation produced dense cover. Few studies provide pre-wildfire and post-wildfire data, especially on mammals at inland woodland sites.

N2  - The bryophyte floristics of industrial/commercial streetscapes of urban Victoria and the importance of various substrata to species richness were explored. Species richness was low compared to healthy natural environments. Thirty mosses from 14 families, and six liverworts, each from different families, were identified. Most species occurred at fewer than 30% of sites, showing the patchy nature of their distribution. Only three species occurred at more than half the sites. Markedly higher species richness occurred on soil than on any other substratum. Epiphytes were extremely few. The low bryodiversity of streetscapes, the patchy nature of the bryophytes and the high number of colonists suggest that the streetscapes have not fulfilled their potential in providing connectivity between urban and non-urban areas. Colonists characteristically occur early in the successional sequence of disturbed areas but, as streetscapes are continually disturbed, colonists effectively are climax species for this habitat. Better management of streetscapes to provide more complex habitat is needed to enable colonisation of these areas by bryophyte species that are more representative of our ever-shrinking natural habitats.

N2  - Long-term datasets of fauna are rare for uninhabited islands in south-eastern Australia. Here we report on 40 years of observations from 1965 to 2005 on the birds of Seal Rocks in northern Bass Strait. Seventy-five native and six exotic species including 21 native passerines were observed at Seal Rocks or nearby. Six species were recorded breeding - Crested Tern Th alasseus bergii, Silver Gull Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae, Sooty Oystercatcher Haematopus fuliginosus, Welcome Swallow Hirundo neoxena, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris and, for the first time in Victoria, Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus. The main changes to breeding birds over the 40 years have been the movement and expansion of the breeding colonies of Crested Terns and Silver Gulls to adjacent parts of nearby Phillip Island, and the arrival and expansion of the breeding Kelp Gull population. Kelp Gulls have increased substantially at Seal Rocks since their arrival in 1968. The first reported breeding for Victoria occurred there in 1971. The expansion of Kelp Gulls may have been associated with the expansion of Australian Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus numbers which, on one hand, has reduced the number of suitable breeding sites but, on the other hand, has increased the amount of food available in the forms of vomited food remains and placentae. The variety of land birds recorded on Seal Rocks was surprisingly high, given the exposed nature and relative sterility of the terrain; however, the strait between Seal Rock and Phillip Island is narrow and all the species recorded there are common in the region and most are wide-ranging seasonally or undertake significant north-south migrations. Records were relatively few aft er 1997 due, in part, to the reduced amount of vegetation on the islets and greatly reduced lengths of research stays. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (1) 2013, 4-21).

N2  - Sleeping aggregations of at least 13 bee species (from the families Halictidae, Apidae, Colletidae and Megachilidae) were observed in the forested and fire-prone landscape of the Lane Cove River valley, in suburban, northern Sydney, NSW, Australia, during the years 2002-2012. Bees were oft en found roosting at sites subjectively assessed as having a lower risk of being burnt. Th e fire risk of the observed sleeping aggregation sites may have been reduced by bees: 1. roosting in smaller vegetation patches, separated by a clearing from larger, nearby areas of vegetation; or 2. roosting in areas of vegetation recently burnt by fire and therefore at a reduced risk of burning; or 3. roosting at or near the edges of vegetation, giving them a chance to escape into adjacent cleared areas, if a fire arrived when there was enough light for the bees to see and fly away; or 4. roosting at or near the edges of tracks or trails, which might act as fire breaks in the event of lower intensity fires; or 5. using combinations of some of the above four 'strategies'. Th is study suggests that sleeping aggregations of bees in this fire-prone area generally appeared to have a tendency to occupy roosting sites that were at a lower risk of being burnt, or sites that probably provided more opportunities for the bees to escape an approaching fire. Th ere are a few indications in the published literature that some bee and wasp species in other fire-prone regions of the world may also have a tendency to occupy lower fire risk roosting sites.

N2  - Koalas were introduced into Framlingham Forest, south-west Victoria, in 1971 and the population grew rapidly. By the 1990s the forest was suffering severe defoliation and many trees preferred by Koalas had been over-browsed. In 1998/99 around 1100 Koalas were captured, the males sterilised and animals translocated to other suitable habitats in western Victoria. Some habitat restoration was subsequently undertaken. In 2007 a deliberately lit fire destroyed most eucalypt foliage and many Koalas were killed or burned and removed by wildlife carers and DSE staff . A survey in 2011 found only two Koalas in the area. A Koala management plan for Framlingham Forest has been prepared. (Th e Victorian Naturalist 130 (1) 2013, 37-40).

N2  - The Eastern Pygmy-possum Cercartetus nanus is a small, omnivorous marsupial found in south-eastern Australia. In Victoria, the present distribution of C. nanus is geographically patchy, generally associated with forests of the Great Dividing Range, but also a range of coastal forests and shrublands. In Box-Ironbark forests of north-central Victoria, C. nanus appears to have undergone a severe population decline. In April 2011, a single Eastern Pygmy-possum was observed in the Redcastle-Graytown State Forest during nocturnal survey work. This is a notable record considering that the species has not otherwise been reported from this area for approximately 40 years. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (1) 2013, 40-44).

N2  - The predators of Australian anurans and their larvae are well documented (Tyler 1976, 1994, Littlejohn and Wainer 1978; Davies et al. 1979; Morgan and Buttemer 1996, Gillespie and Hero 1999). By contrast, little has been published on the sources of predation of their spawn. Tyler (1976, 1994) states that there are relatively few predators of frog spawn and that 'fish probably constitute the major predator'. He notes in particular that the foam nests of the genus Limnodynastes are probably most accessible to terrestrial insects because they tend to be located around the edges of ponds where they are attached to peripheral vegetation, and that they are occasionally eaten by ants. Members of the Australian frog genus Limnodynastes produce floating foam-capped nests below which the egg mass resides (Parker 1940; Tyler and Davies 1979; Roberts 1989). One member of this genus, the Spotted Marsh Frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, is a very common species throughout much of south-eastern Australia where it breeds in most months of the year in both temporary and permanent water bodies and in a wide variety of both natural and manmade habitats (Barker et al. 1995; Hero et al. 1991; Littlejohn 2003). Herein I report the predation of L. tasmaniensis spawn by leeches in an ephemeral wetland near Melbourne some 25 years ago and compare these observations with a very similar report of predation documented by Burgin and Schell (2005) in the Sydney area.

N2  - Surveys of 49 Warm Temperate Rainforest gullies in East Gippsland identified discrete populations of Yellowwood Acronychia oblongifolia in 34 gullies. Antler rubbing of Yellow-wood by Sambar Cervus unicolor was obvious and widespread in all 34 gullies. Eight gullies were randomly selected to assess the extent of antler rubbing to 100 Yellow-wood plants in each gully (50 plants close to two randomly generated locations). Across all eight gullies an average of 64.6% (+/- 17.7 sd; range 36-92%) of Yellow-wood individuals were antler rubbed, with 51.0% (+/- 17.8 sd; range 18-80%) subjected to severe rubbing (>50% ringbarking), with mortality recorded at 30.3% (+/- 14.0 sd; range 6-52%). Yellow-wood with stems in the range 30-150 mm diameter at breast height (DBH) were subjected to the highest rates of antler rubbing (73-81%), with smaller stems (10-16 mm DBH) suffering the highest rates of mortality. Sambar represent a major threat to the long-term persistence of Yellowwood and rainforest communities in East Gippsland.

N2  - Threatened species signage is frequently used to help protect species by limiting human occurrence or altering damaging human behaviour, yet is rarely developed using a scientific approach that involves collecting data from the key target audience in regard to their preferences for signs and placement of signs. We surveyed members of the beach-going public (n = 684) to document their preferences for desirable features and positioning of signage to protect threatened beach-nesting birds. The results suggest a preference for information relating to education and persuasion over details of regulation. However, preferences differed between recreational user groups, suggesting that target audiences should be identified specifically and prioritised. We also describe clear preferences between four candidate signs, which will facilitate a more informed choice of signage for beach-nesting bird management.

N2  - The Masked Lapwing Vanellus miles is a common ground-nesting shorebird inhabiting grasslands, paddocks, rivers, lakes, swamps and, tidal mud flats. It is particularly common in the urban areas of Phillip Island, Victoria (Dann 1981; Marchant and Higgins 1993). The Masked Lapwing usually lays between one and four eggs (the mean number of eggs per clutch of this study was 3.6 +/- 1 SD) that hatch after 31 days. Both sexes incubate eggs, brood young and defend the eggs and young. Masked Lapwings produce precocial and nidifugous chicks that remain with the adults on defended territories until fledging (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Thomas 1969). The chicks are able to feed themselves within hours of hatching and rely on their parents only for protection (alarm signals) and warmth (brooding) (Marchant and Higgins 1993).

N2  - Recent botanical surveys in semi-arid woodlands in the Victorian Mallee have provided further records of 28 plant species considered rare or threatened. The threat status of 10 species is recommended for review, as they appear to be more common than in their current listing. Botanical collections in 2012 include the first Victorian specimen record for the Desert New Holland Daisy Vittadinia eremaea. The records of these rare or threatened plants come aft er two decades of browsing and grazing control, which enabled the woodland flora to take advantage of the breaking of the drought in 2010. From 2010 to 2012 rainfall extended into the normally dry summers, providing two consecutive and unusually benign summers with good recruitment opportunities. Low grazing and browsing pressure is a necessary precursor for regeneration of many of these species and the semi-arid woodland they constitute. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (3) 2013, 96-108).

N2  - The four Australian species of Dasyurus currently possess linguistically or geographically inappropriate vernacular names (Western Quoll D. geoff roii; Northern Quoll D. hallucatus; Spotted-tailed Quoll D. maculatus; and Eastern Quoll D. viverrinus). The Western Quoll originally occurred extensively in eastern Australia, the Eastern Quoll originally occurred only in south-eastern Australia (including Tasmania), and the Aboriginal name 'quoll' strictly refers to D. hallucatus in north Queensland. A search of anthropological, zoological, and newspaper sources has revealed >400 names (including duplications) used by Aborigines, with most being readily assignable to a particular species. It is recommended that an Aboriginal name for each species be selected and used consistently by zoologists and conservation agencies, namely Chuditch (D. geoff roii); Digul (D. hallucatus); Bindjulang (D. maculatus); and Luaner (D. viverrinus).The rationale for selecting these names is explained.

N2  - In temperate ecosystems, invasive alien species pose a major threat to species diversity. The first step in understanding likely ecological consequences of invasive species is to record new distributions. Three invertebrate species likely to affect Australian alpine and subalpine ecosystems are recorded for the first time above 1500 masl from the Victorian Alps: European Honey Bee Apis mellifera L., Grey Field Slug Deroceras reticulatum Muller, and European Wasp Vespula germanica (F.). Single records of other invasive alien species are mentioned but not explored. I present a simple online tool that is commonly used to model the distribution of species. Results show the value of extensive sampling, naturalist records and the need for reliable species distribution data. Building ecological models that can predict the likely consequences of invasive species is reliant on continual updating of historical species distribution records.

N2  - In October 2011, two small spiders built adjoining webs under the eaves and patio roof on the south side of our house in the Melbourne suburb of Notting Hill. By November 2012 the web had become a large, rambling, bluish tinted, messy-looking structure that measured approximately 1900 x 900 x 600 mm. Most people would have swept it away right at the start, but I decided to leave it alone and see what I could find out about its occupants.

It was not until 2008 that fruit-bodies of a large bolete Phlebopus marginatus began to appear on the ground under one of the Long-leaved Box trees. This fungus has grown in the same area most years since. I didn't see it in 2012, but it reappeared in the autumn of 2013, when it also grew near the Silver-leaved Stringybark.

N2  - With over two thirds of Victoria in private ownership, the value of private land conservation is pivotal to the future of the state's biodiversity. Trust for Nature has been working for 40 years to protect conservation values on private land across Victoria. The Trust has worked with over 1000 landholders to permanently protect 52 287 ha with legally-binding conservation covenants. In the same period, Trust for Nature has strategically purchased 111 properties, currently retaining 46, representing an additional 42 842 ha of under permanent protection. The Trust has also been involved in major conservation campaigns. Through these and other measures, Trust for Nature has been actively involved in the conservation of some of Victoria's most threatened species and communities, including within urban landscapes.

N2  - Cooperation of scientists, conservation agencies and the wider community is critical for pursuing invertebrate conservation, but many problems can arise in promoting this approach effectively. They are exemplified here by consideration of four notable flagship species in Victoria: the Giant Gippsland earthworm, Golden sun-moth, Eltham copper butterfly and Ancient greenling damselfly, which are supported to varying extents by recovery teams and normal recovery plans and by community enthusiasm and participation in their conservation.

N2  - In the world of threatened species recovery - or indeed any environmental effort - there seems to be an ever increasing amount to do and an ever decreasing amount of funding to achieve it with. As the number of threatened species increases, so too does a growing group of organisations, government bodies, recovery teams, catchment management authorities, park managers, zoos, universities and community groups wanting to focus their efforts on helping these species avoid extinction. Contained within these groups is an array of expertise on particular species, practical conservation knowledge, research and on-ground action that can benefit species in their fight for survival. However, many environmental groups often work independently as they strive to save species, competing with each other for funding and resources even though all have a common goal. In order to be effective in threatened species recovery, collaboration may hold the key. This article will explore Conservation Volunteers Australia's Wild Futures program as an example of how collaborative partnerships can strengthen efforts towards assisting the recovery of endangered species.

N2  - The engagement of non-professionals in scientific research is referred to as 'citizen science'. Citizen science is important for answering research questions that rely on a large number of data collectors, and can be used to inform the public about scientific topics. Using the Melbourne Microbat Project as an example, we discuss the benefits of engaging the public in scientific research. The Melbourne Microbat Project included over 100 volunteers, who helped collect detailed data on urban bat populations. The involvement of volunteers in this project was a positive experience for both scientists and volunteers. We also give advice to scientists and volunteers about setting up and getting involved in a citizen science project, and provide details on two ongoing citizen science projects in which volunteers can get involved.

N2  - This study gathers key baseline data on the vegetation of tern colony sites at Lake Tyers and establishes permanent plots for future monitoring. We characterised the vegetation, substrate type, soil moisture, pH and nutrient levels of Little Tern Sternula albifrons and Fairy Tern S. nereis colony sites at three islands in Lake Tyers estuary, Victoria. Monitoring plots were established at two colony sites and four non-colony sites, including one abandoned colony site. Vegetation cover was estimated using the point quadrat method. We found that terns nested in areas with 84% +/- 1.89 vegetation cover, potentially much higher than reported in previous studies; however, conclusions should be made with caution given the low replication in our study. There was no significant difference in vegetation attributes between colony and non-colony sites. A long-term study including other colony areas along the Victorian coastline would be valuable in understanding colony requirements of these threatened species. This is especially important in the context of the climate change-induced impacts predicted to affect coastal environments in the future. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (5) 2013, 192-201).

N2  - One of several possible endpoints for animals removed from the wild for research purposes is to return those animals (or their progeny) to the wild. However, this endpoint involves risks to wild populations that can be damaging, such as behavioural problems or failure to locate suitable resources, or even catastrophic, such as the introduction or spread of pathogens and disease. Whilst the risk of pathogen transfer can be low for any given release, the consequences when it does occur can be extreme. Risks such as transferring novel or emerging pathogens from captivity to wild populations can occur before pathogens are known to occur. This situation occurred with the introduction to Australia of the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, which probably entered wild populations via infected captive frogs before the pathogen that causes the disease was identified. I argue that reptiles and frogs removed from the wild in Victoria should not be returned to the wild, and discuss some alternative endpoints for these animals.

N2  - In 2000, a trial program of management of the Wonthaggi Heathland Nature Conservation Reserve was implemented. This used the slash and burn technique in small patches of vegetation. The aims were: to assess the invasion of Coast Tea-tree 'Leptospermum laevigatum', to determine the effect of each treatment on species richness and to observe the response of weeds and orchids. Post-treatment monitoring was carried out in 2008, 2009 and 2012. The results from this trial show that these management strategies reduce the invasion of Sand and Wet Heathland EVCs by Coast Tea-tree and enhance species diversity. It would be appropriate to extend the area of management and continue to monitor the results over the long term. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (5) 2013, 212-218).

N2  - Jumping spiders belonging to the endemic Australian genus Maratus are popularly referred to as peacock spiders, so called for the remarkable courtship displays of the often brightly coloured males. Several Maratus splendens were found in Buldah State Forest, East Gippsland in 2011 and 2013, representing the first records of this species from Victoria. Until recently, this species was known only from around Sydney. While a degree of caution should be exercised whenever implying possible new distributional records based on single localities, it is considered most likely that this discovery represents a genuine expansion in the known range of Maratus splendens. Details are also provided for a previously unpublished record from the central coast of New South Wales. (The Victorian Naturalist 130 (6) 2013, 224-231).

N2  - It is widely assumed that regardless of the community in question, recently burnt forests are less flammable than long-unburnt areas, so that the fire-flammability feedback is negative. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed for Snowgum forest/woodland based on deterministic fire behaviour modelling, describing a positive feedback where mature forests are significantly less flammable than more recently burnt areas. To test this, the relative area burnt by wildfire was examined for 53 years of mapped fire history in 190 000 ha of subalpine Snowgum across the Australian Alps National Parks in south-eastern Australia. Results supported the deterministic modelling, demonstrating that where forest has been burnt in the previous 14 years, subsequent fires have burnt 2.3 times as much area as they did in older forests (p = 0.05). These findings provide validation for the modelling and suggest far reaching consequences for subalpine and alpine areas in the context of a warming climate.

N2  - The seasonal changes in abundance of bird species and individuals in subalpine woodland in the Munyang Valley were studied from 2000 to 2012. The immediate response of the avifauna to the fires of 2003 was a reduction in the number of species (from 12 to 7) and individuals (by 77%). Key to these reductions was the loss of foraging substrates that did not recover quickly, such as shrubs and the tree canopy, bark, lower branches and leaves. The general response of the avifauna was in contrast to other areas in south-eastern Australia, particularly with the slower recovery of vegetation due to low growth rates and trees regenerating from lignotuber tillers rather than epicormic shoots. The Flame Robin Petroica phoenicea was the first to re-occupy the woodland, with winter resident species being next to return. After ten years, the canopy had still not regrown, adversely affecting canopy foraging species, particularly seed eaters, while food sources such as flowers of Grevillea victoriae were not available in pre-fire amounts, slowing the return of honeyeaters.

N2  - Wildfire is a common occurrence in south-eastern Australia and affects fauna populations in various ways. In fragmented landscapes severe wildfire may lead to local extinction of some species; however, in other cases natural features such as cracks in the soil may provide refuges and the opportunity for some taxa to survive and recolonise surrounding areas. There is a lack of studies that provide both pre-wildfire and post-wildfire data on reptiles and amphibians especially at inland woodland sites. Data were collected to determine the presence and relative abundance of vertebrate fauna at a site near Moyston in Western Victoria on three occasions pre-wildfire and on seven occasions post-wildfire. Ten reptile and five amphibian species were recorded pre-wildfire, whilst 11 reptile and eight amphibian species were recorded post-wildfire. Bibron's Toadlet Pseudophryne bibronii, a species listed as threatened in Victoria, survived the wildfire in significant numbers in parts of the property severely burnt by wildfire. Several other species were recorded post-wildfire in sections of the property that were severely burnt. Numerous species appear to have survived the wildfire due to their ability to shelter underground, whilst others may have sheltered under large logs that were only partially burnt. Populations of other species may have survived due to a combination of breeding cycles, low metabolic rates and time of fire. At least one species of reptile may have recolonised the property from unburnt areas in neighbouring districts.

N2  - The Fauna Survey Group of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria has a program for monitoring nestboxes in the box-ironbark forests near Rushworth, Victoria. In addition to its normal monitoring program, in May 2012 five remote cameras were set up for 23 nights with a view to monitoring the Sugar Glider and Phascogale activity at selected sites. The cameras produced images of nestbox inhabitant activity, as well as that of some visitor animals. At face value the results of this simple survey provide support for previous research into the behaviour and activity of the target species around nesting sites. The images showed that both species are active only between dusk and dawn, they both have periods of inactivity and both use multiple nesting sites; however, there were also gaps in 'evidence', which demonstrate that some camera settings and site set-up processes need to be adjusted to increase the confidence in any findings.

N2  - During March 2012, whilst undertaking an aerial survey of an overmature Mountain Ash Eucalyptus regnans in Toolangi State Forest, a Spencer's Skink Pseudemoia spenceri was observed in the canopy at a height of 5 m above ground level. In the following year, whilst surveying another overmature E..regnans, a pair of P..spenceri was detected at similar height within the canopy. These sightings demonstrate that thermoregulation in P. spenceri is not restricted to dead trees and that high canopies of overmature trees may be an important component of its habitat. Due to the difficulty of accessing the forest canopy it is likely that our understanding of arboreal habitat use has been underestimated for small vertebrates such as skinks. Our serendipitous sightings emphasise the need for further research in this area.

N2  - The Fauna Survey Group of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria currently is undertaking a wide ranging fauna survey in three parkland complexes east of Melbourne, in conjunction with Parks Victoria and interested volunteers. The main survey techniques are remote cameras, hair tubes, spotlights, harp traps, artificial habitat (tiles and tin) and sound recorders. Parks Victoria, Melbourne Water and the Knox Environment Society have provided financial support. Boral Industries have provided roof tiles. Fauna monitoring is a necessary part of environmental management and is often not well funded. This project provides an opportunity to gain an understanding of the best methods for monitoring important species; how members of the community can best be involved; and how the program might best be supported in the longer term.

N2  - Distance between leaf teeth was examined in the cool temperate rainforest tree Austral Mulberry Hedycarya angustifolia A. Cunn. to determine whether this leaf character has the potential to be used as an environmental proxy. Photometric analysis was undertaken from Victorian herbarium-lodged specimens of H. angustifolia from 1852 to 2010. Regression analysis revealed no significant change in mean distance between leaf teeth in response to an increase of 0.9 degrees C in mean annual temperature (MAT). From this preliminary analysis, distance between leaf teeth appears to be non-responsive to changes in MAT. It is possible that increases in MAT over the study period were insufficient to elicit a response in this leaf character, or that other environmental factors and/or intrinsic variation within this species may obscure any possible MAT signal. Future studies will be required to identify any probable drivers of this leaf character. (The Victorian Naturalist 131 (2) 2014, 36-39).

N2  - A single plant of the Southern Spider-orchid Caladenia australis G.W. Carr was collected beside Lady Barron foreshore on Flinders Island in November 1968. It remains the sole Tasmanian record to date. The species is scheduled under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 as endangered. Its Tasmanian habitat is described and the later searches for the species are dealt with. The restricted occurrence of four other Spiderorchids, each also found just once on Flinders Island, is detailed. (The Victorian Naturalist 131 (2) 2014, 40-43).

N2  - Round-leaf Pomaderris 'Pomaderris vacciniifolia' F. Muell. ex Reissek (Rhamnaceae) is a Victorian endemic shrub listed as threatened under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and critically endangeredunder the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. A review of the available literature for P. vacciniifolia indicated most information is anecdotal or found in unpublished works. Better understanding of the ecology of 'P. vacciniifolia' may help explain why it is vulnerable, and enhance future management. Future research should focus towards better understanding of 'P. vacciniifolia' habitat, reproductive ecology, seed dispersal mechanisms and competitive ability and how these compare with more common sympatric congeners, to determine whether any differences could explain the relative success of these species. Targeted searches for this species on public and private land are warranted to reveal additional populations and fully appreciate the distribution of this species.

N2  - Having received the (dubious, some might say) honour of having a species of Australian frog named after me, I was led to reflect on some of the quirks and curiosities of the system which endows animals (and plants) with names dreamed up by scientists. 'My' frog is called Uperoleia martini (one of my colleagues instantly and unkindly remarked: Sounds more like a new kind of drink than a new kind of frog). In the description of the animal it is said to have 'moderately long hind limbs' and 'no webbing between the toes', which I can live with quite comfortably. On the other hand it also possesses 'a well-developed supracloacal flap' and 'cream patches in the groin', which are the kinds of thing you don't like even your closest friends to know about.

N2  - While staying at Thurra River in Croajingolong National Park, my wife and I with two friends witnessed one of the best nature events of my 70 years. It occurred on 30th November 2013. My lady friend and I are both keen birders and we became interested in unusual calls coming from an acacia sapling of about 4 to 5 metres and quite close to our camping spot. When we investigated we were surprised to find that the calls were coming from several Yellow-faced Honeyeaters. They were making soft whimpering type noises that we had not heard before. My friend then observed a large snake about two metres up the tree. The snake was trying to reach out to a nest. At this stage, we were unsure of what species it was.

N2  - On 13 January 2014, while walking with my six-year-old grandson near the eastern end of Normanby Road in the Melbourne suburb of Notting Hill (Melway map 70 J10), we found a bird's nest on the footpath near a eucalypt. The nest was made of thin strips of bark and lined with a white, fluffy synthetic material. I put it in our 'collection bag of interesting items', brought it home, and later left it on the ground in our garden. The next day, when I went to refill one of our birdbaths, I was surprised to find the bird's nest soaking in it.

N2  - The Stuttering Frog, 'Mixophyes balbus', is a threatened species restricting to upland streams in coastal drainages of southeastern Australia. There have been no confirmed sightings of this species in Victoria since 1983 and it has suffered marked declines throughout its range. We undertook surveys targeting suitable habitat throughout the potential Victorian extent of range of the species, in order to detect any remaining populations and ascertain its current conservation status. Nineteen stream reaches on 12 different streams were sampled with a total of 41.7 km of watercourse searched. No Stuttering frogs were detected, but all other frog species expected to be associated with streams in the area were frequently detected. These findings build on previous evidence that the Stuttering Frog has declined throughout its range, and may in fact now be extinct in the wild in Victoria.

Eleven species, eight reptile and three frog species, were recorded using burrows as refugia. Of these, six species were found to occupy burrows made by invertebrates, mammals and other reptiles while eight species were found to construct their own burrows. A close association between two burrowing skinks, the Eastern Striped Skink Ctenotus robustus and Southern Lerista Lerista bougainvillii, and the occurrence of Corangamite stony loam soil is identified and discussed.

N2  - The first Tasmanian record of the Prickly Arrowgrass Triglochin mucronata R.Br. was made in a small seasonal lagoon on Vansittart Island in the Furneaux Group in 1969. The Arrowgrass was then found at three sites on Flinders Island. The first two, made in late 1970, were beside the Long Point Saltings and on the nearby Long Point sedge flat. The final early record was made on the inner side of the blocked mouth of Camerons Inlet in 1976. The records made when the Flinders Island localities were searched in 2007, and the two major areas were checked in 2012 and 2013, are set out. The threats to the various localities are noted and suggestions made to safeguard them. The taxon is scheduled, under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, as 'endangered'.

N2  - The site of European settlement in the Port Phillip region was a place of many swamps. For the Indigenous population these features were essential to their way of life, because of the wide diversity of foodstuffs and raw materials they provided. They were the main support for the meetings of large numbers of the Kulin nation that occurred regularly around the top of the Bay. As the immigrant population of Melbourne increased so too were the indigenes excluded from their customary haunts, and were thus eventually unable to maintain their traditional ways. The immigrant settlers viewed the swamps in a different light: they were a source of disease, and of such little regard they could be used as dumping grounds. As Melbourne grew and the need to improve commercial facilities increased, these areas were progressively transformed into a range of other, more culturally useful forms. The ways in which these wetlands played a part in the histories of both Indigenous and settler populations are examined. (The Victorian Naturalist 131 (4) 2014, 96-105).

N2  - The Gippsland Lakes are one of Australia's most important and highly used estuarine complexes. Development pressures have caused the degradation of many of the Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetlands that fringe the Gippsland Lakes. Two developments stand out as critically important: i) the creation of a permanent opening to Bass Strait in 1889 at Lakes Entrance; and ii) the increasing extraction of freshwater from the Latrobe, Macalister and Thomson Rivers for use by irrigators and industry and as a supply of potable water for Melbourne. One of the largest of the Ramsar-listed wetlands in the Gippsland Lakes - Dowd Morass - was the subject of an intensive rehabilitation project from 2003 to 2007. The project benefited greatly from community involvement, particularly with revegetation efforts and in the re-establishment of more natural wetting and drying regimes. The benefits and limitations of community involvement are discussed, with a focus on community perceptions of wetland values and degradation; the impacts of carp and of exotic weeds are two cases where there was little congruence between the perceptions of community groups and those of professional aquatic ecologists. The wider use of conceptual models is one way to improve understanding and enhance collaboration across different groups in large, multi-disciplinary projects that seek to rehabilitate high-value coastal wetlands.

N2  - Some ground-nesting birds adopt a mixed strategy of nesting in the open, or under cover (e.g. vegetation). This may represent a trade-off between thermally favourable nest sites (covered) and those that enable the early detection and avoidance of predators (open). This study examined whether such a trade-off exists for Red-capped Plover Charadrius ruficapillus, whose eggs are preyed upon principally by Little Raven Corvus mellori. For real and artificial nests, nest temperatures under cover (real, 25.9 +/= 0.1 degreesC; false, 16.2 +/= 0.5 degreesC) were cooler than those in the open (real, 26.8 +/= 0.1 degreesC; false, 17.4 +/= 0.9 degreesC). Covered nests had more visual obstructions than open nests (covered, 65.5% +/= 11.4%; open, 7.4% 2.8%) and a standardised measure of incubator escape distance, initiated by experimental human approaches, indicated incubators fled open nests at longer distances than for covered nests. Nests under cover showed a slightly (non-significant) higher probability of surviving one day (Daily Survival Rate [DSR] = 0.978) than those in the open (DSR = 0.950). For false nests containing model eggs, covered nests exhibited better survival to 10 days compared with open nests (20.4% vs. 4.7%). Thus, covered nests are associated with enhanced thermal environments and egg survival, but predators can approach the incubator more closely. Overall, the proposed trade-off between thermal and predation risks associated with nest sites appears to exist and explains the ongoing occurrence of nests in open and covered locations.

N2  - Across south-eastern Australia the loss of natural wetlands since European settlement has been substantial such that even constructed waterbodies that provide a measure of habitat for waterbirds can assume importance for their conservation. Melbourne Water operates the Western Treatment Plant (WTP), occupying 10 500 ha near Werribee, primarily for the treatment of some 54% of Melbourne's industrial and domestic wastewater. During 1982 the site was included as a component of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar site in recognition of its great importance for waterfowl (Anseriformes and Podicipediformes), shorebirds (Charadriiformes) and wading birds (Ciconiiformes and Gruiformes). The WTP supports other biodiversity values, with a significant population of the nationally Vulnerable Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis; a number of threatened species of plant, including the Spiny Rice-flower Pimelea spinescens subsp. spinescens; and two listed vegetation communities: Natural Temperate Grassland of the Victorian Volcanic Plain (Critically Endangered), and Subtropical and Temperate Coastal Saltmarsh (Vulnerable). This paper describes how site managers have endeavoured since 2002 to implement adaptive management to protect and promote the WTP's recognised biodiversity values during necessary sewage treatment upgrades. Results of management on waterfowl populations are obscured by the effects of the 1997-2009 drought across south-eastern Australia and species' inherent variability in distribution across this vast area. A trial addition of straw to promote waterfowl food in one wetland showed no clear benefits. However, after 12 years of close monitoring of target populations our knowledge is much improved and we believe the site retains the biodiversity values that led to it being listed as a wetland of international importance.

N2  - The Western Treatment Plant (WTP) is an outstanding example of a case where the waste water from a large city (Melbourne) is used to provide habitat for waterfowl and other birds. This paper provides a brief summary of the results of monitoring waterfowl numbers over 12 years, documenting the high numbers of many waterfowl species that the WTP supports (often >100 000 birds in total). Active and adaptive management by Melbourne Water based on ongoing monitoring strives to maintain WTP's value for waterfowl. (TheVictorian Naturalist 131 (4) 2014, 147-149).

N2  - We tested the 'cars cause less disturbance' hypothesis by comparing the flight-initiation distance (FID) evoked by a car versus a single walker for 38 species of waterbird (n = 657 standardised approaches). For the 15 species where we had sample size adequate for statistical testing (n &#8805; 5), we found that cars elicited shorter responses after controlling for starting distance. Within-species analyses revealed that this difference was significant in 8 of 15 species. Although mean FIDs for car approaches were always shorter than FIDs toward single walkers in the remaining species (7), the tests in those species lacked sufficient power to draw meaningful conclusions. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that birds respond to cars at shorter distances. The wide taxonomic breadth of species investigated suggests that this principle may be broadly applicable, at least in waterbirds. The results of this study and the FID estimates we present will allow development of meaningful stimulus-specific buffer zones to protect waterbirds from disturbance.

N2  - The rate of vocalisations in Little Penguin Eudyptula minor was documented to determine whether human presence (handling of penguins), gender and weight influenced vocal production. Observations were conducted during volunteer research nights and a total of 50 penguins were studied at the St Kilda penguin colony. Focal individual penguins were observed for vocal rate continuously within 1 minute focal scans. Rates of vocalisations were documented as rate of vocalisation per penguin and correlated with capture experience, gender and weight. Rates of vocalisation were significantly influenced by capture experience and handling time and suggest vocalisations may be used as a gauge to assess impact (e.g. human presence) across time in avian tourism settings. Levels of tolerance (reducing or ceasing to respond to the stimulus) may be indicative of habituation and such data could be valuable for the management of avian tourism.

N2  - A vegetation survey of the Cocoparra National Park and Cocoparra Nature Reserve completed in 1992-96 was partially repeated during 2004 and 2005 with 26 of the original sites being re-surveyed. Cryptogams were collected in the 2004-05 surveys and some soil analyses were completed. Sites surveyed covered 14 of the 16 vegetation units in the area. Two hundred and eight vascular plants were recorded and included 43 introduced species. These numbers compared well with those of the earlier surveys; 41 species recorded in the 2004-05 survey were not recorded in the earlier survey and 48 species recorded in the 1992-96 survey were not found in the later survey. Twenty-three mosses, 13 liverworts and hornworts and 47 lichens were recorded in the 2004-05 survey. (The Victorian Naturalist 131 (5) 2014, 162-176)

N2  - The Eastern Small-eyed Snake Cryptophis nigrescens is a small nocturnal elapid found along the east coast of Australia from Melbourne in Victoria to Cooktown in Queensland (Cogger 2014). During the cooler months of the year, the species frequently shelters beneath exfoliated rocks (Webb et al. 2004) and is often found in small aggregations (Scott et al. 2013). The Eastern Small-eyed Snake actively forages for food (Webb et al. 2003) and is thought to prey principally on small scincid lizards, although it has been reported consuming a variety of other reptile prey in low numbers (Shine 1984). For ex ample, Shine (1984) examined the gut contents of Eastern Small-eyed Snakes from Australian Museum, Queensland Museum, National Museum of Victoria and Australian National Wildlife Collection and found snakes from NSW included prey items such as the Copper-tailed Skink Ctenotus taeniolatus, Delicate Skink Lampropholis delicata, Garden Skink L. guichenoti, Weasel Skink Saproscincus mustelinus, Eulamprus sp. and a single Mustard-bellied Snake Drysdalia rhodogaster. A similar dietary composition was reported for Victorian specimens (Shine 1984). Queensland specimens, however, contained a much broader range of scindid lizards, as well as a Burton's Snake-lizard Lialis burtonis, Ramphotyphlops sp. and several additional small elapids (Shine 1984). Presumably the dietary breadth of Queensland snakes is due to the greater diversity of species available.

N2  - Bryophytes have been used widely as biomonitors to map distribution of pollutant concentrations for many years, but their reliability has been questioned. One issue was the variability of uptake capacity within a species. Many potential reasons have been suggested for this, both intrinsic and extrinsic. This paper provides a brief review of arsenic uptake and tolerance within plants, particularly bryophytes, and examines the variability in uptake of arsenic using Bryum dichotomum Hedw., a moss, as a model organism. Samples were used from two sites, one with low and one with high arsenic emission levels. Differences in uptake were noted and it is suggested that these differences are the result of acclimation to exposure levels at the site from which they were removed. This acclimation could be simple hardening common to many plants or genetic differentiation into ecotypes. The findings of this study have implications with regards to the suitability of bryophytes as biomonitors of metal pollution. (The Victorian Naturalist 131(6), 2014, 192-203)

N2  - Ronald Campbell Gunn was one of the foremost Australian plant collectors who sent specimens to William and Joseph Hooker during the first half of the nineteenth century, until he abruptly broke off all correspondence. In a letter sent to Joseph Hooker two decades later, in 1870, Gunn reveals the reasons for this hiatus, and sends specimens of Tasmanian Acacia species and of a New Zealand plant now known as Phormium cookianum subsp. hookeri (Gunn ex Hook. f.). Remarks in the letter on these specimens reveal a controversy with Ferdinand Mueller on definition of species, and allow correction of the erroneous locality for the Phormium later published by Hooker.

N2  - Though once prolific across the continent, the rainforests of Australia have receded to a fraction of their original extent. In Victoria, rainforests account for as little as 0.14% of the state, and a disproportionately large number of species are found within them. As rainforests are found where temperatures are mild and rainfall is consistent and high, the prospect of a changing climate threatens their structure, function, and possibly their existence. This desktop study investigated climate predictions based on various emissions scenarios, and compared them to current characteristics and requirements of Victoria's cool temperate rainforests to determine the impact they could have on these forests, particularly the most iconic species found within them, such as Atherosperma moschatum Labill. c Labill. and Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst, which may be most at risk to the effects of climate change, particularly fire. The study explores the impact a changing climate may have on the rainforests of Victoria and focuses on some key canopy species of cool temperate rainforest. It also brings into light the need for more research into climate change in conjunction with other key ecosystem factors such as soil type, elevation and human disturbance.

N2  - The role of native top predators in regulating terrestrial ecosystems in south-east Australia is briefly reviewed. Examples of ecological imbalance associated with overabundant native herbivores are identified. The cases of tree canopy loss due to excessive browsing by Koala and Common Ringtail Possum are discussed. The widespread loss of native top predators has left two introduced mesopredators, the Red Fox and Cat, to regulate both native and introduced herbivores in many areas. However, being ground-based predators, they are not efficient at controlling ringtail possums in dense vegetation, and without the top predator Dingo they may be ecologically released, increasing their impact on sensitive fauna. Management approaches to keeping a balance between predators and herbivores are outlined.

N2  - My wife and I live on a property on the basalt plain formed by the lava flow from Mt Warrnambool in south-western Victoria. Our property consists of 20.2 ha of remnant native vegetation and is almost completely surrounded by paddocks; however, it is linked to other areas of native vegetation (both larger and smaller than ours) by a network of corridors consisting of roadside vegetation, vegetation on the sides of the nearby creek, and uncleared road reserves. Our property is within the fragmented forest environment at Naringal. According to Bennett (1988; 1989), less than 10% of the forest that previously covered this area has not been cleared; none of the remaining forest patches are larger than 100 ha, and 90% are smaller than 20 ha. The canopy of our property is mainly Messmate 'Eucalyptus obliqua' but with patches of Manna Gum 'E. viminalis' and Swamp Gum E. ovata. The ground cover is mainly Austral Bracken 'Pteridium esculentum' but with Variable Sword-sedge 'Lepidosperma laterale' in wetter areas and grasses and herbs in drier, rockier areas.

This locality is west-north-west of Wonthaggi, and is accessed by the Mouth of Powlett (MoP) Road, which joins the Bass Highway east of Kilcunda. This visit came about because, when browsing some older copies of 'The Victorian Naturalist', I came across an interesting article by Pat Carolan about White Sallee (or lowland Snow Gum) in this area (Carolan 1983). As I was planning a trip along the Bass Highway, I decided to make a short diversion to see if I could find this rather remote remnant.

N2  - A study to obtain records of the endangered Inland Carpet Python Morelia spilota metcalfei Wells & Wellington 1984 was conducted in the North East Catchment Management Area, north-east Victoria, between August 2010 and February 2011. A range of survey methods were used to procure recent and historical records. In terviews with resident landholders and staff from natural resource management agencies produced 27 python records from 18 new localities. Nineteen records were authenticated and eight records remained unconfirmed. Most sightings were made by resident landholders from the late 1960s to the early 1980s and originated from Mount Pilot, Burrowa-Pine Mountain, Mount Mittamatite, Mount Granya, Mudgegonga, Rosewhite and the Warby Ranges. These new localities should be considered in regional and statewide conservation planning for the species. Vegetation assessments at each location revealed an association with Granitic Hills Woodland (EVC No. 72), confirming that north-facing remnants and granite landforms are important habitat for the Inland Carpet Python in north-east Victoria, and warrant further protection. Fire planning in the upper Mur ray region should consider fire intensity and the seasonal timing of burns to reduce the risk of habitat loss and mortality. Key recommendations, based on the ecological requirements of the Inland Carpet Python, include implementing small-scale, low intensity fires during late autumn.

N2  - Researchers conducting trapping surveys of vertebrate fauna are required to use a range of measures to ensure the wellbeing of captured animals. These include procedures to protect small mammals captured during pitfall trapping. Various materials can be placed in pitfall traps to provide shelter for small mammals, especially those captured overnight. During long-term studies at three sites in southern and western Victoria, two species of small marsupials used polystyrene cups that were placed in pitfall traps for shelter.

N2  - The New South Wales (NSW) north coast has a diverse marine bivalve and gastropod fauna of biogeographical interest. A field survey at Shelly Beach, on the NSW lower north coast over the period 2009-2015, complemented by a review of data from secondary sources, identified 142 species comprising 34 bivalves (24 families) and 108 gastropods (51 families). It is likely that further survey effort, particularly targeting micro-molluscs less than 5 mm in size, would identify additional species. The molluscan fauna of Shelly Beach reflects the location of the NSW north coast in an overlap zone between the tropical Indo-West Pacific region to the north and the temperate southern Australian region to the south. Temperate zone species comprised about 63% of the identified species diversity, sub-tropical species about 20%, overlap zone endemics about 12% and widespread species about 5%.

N2  - Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are predators of aphid and psyllid species and are often released or encouraged into timber plantations as natural enemies of economic pests. Some temperate coccinellid species overwinter in mass aggregations; however, little is known about coccinellid aggregations in Australia. Aggregations of 'Harmonia conformis' were observed only on stone walls of a camp shelter near Shelley, Victoria in July 2014. Publication of more observational records and dedicated surveys will determine if old stone walls and buildings in managed landscapes have the potential to provide overwintering habitat for natural enemies and other beneficial insects.

N2  - Understanding the functional role of invasive species is important for better management of ecosystems. Exotic willows ('Salix' spp.) are widespread riparian trees of temperate Australia and New Zealand. Despite being classed as weeds of national significance, little is known of their effects on ecosystem function. Extensive growth of complex willow root mats in streams they infest has created a novel littoral habitat. Spatial and temporal changes of macroinvertebrates in willow root mats and bare bank habitats were examined in three central Victorian rivers to gain an understanding of their effects on this faunal group. Macroinvertebrate richness, abundance, biomass and diversity were significantly higher (p<0.05) in willow root habitats compared to open bank habitats. This suggests willow root mats have created a new niche for macroinvertebrate communities in willow-infested streams in Australia and emphasises the need for concurrent habitat enrichment programs when removal of exotic vegetation takes place.

N2  - In January 2009, a mass aggregation of over 100 Port Jackson sharks 'Heterodontus portusjacksoni' was noticed during a recreational snorkel at the Point Cooke Marine Sanctuary. The sharks (which all appeared to be female) were observed over two consecutive days in January 2009, after which they evidently departed en masse. The habitat being used at Point Cooke Marine Sanctuary appeared to be different from that typically used by this species (which from literature sources appears to include caves and rock ledges that allow sharks to be 'tucked away' and difficult to access). The reasons for the aggregation are unknown, but no sharks were observed to be actively foraging at the time of the aggregation, nor participating in any mating or egg-laying behaviour, suggesting that a male avoidance strategy may have been implemented by these animals.

N2  - Although mortality to frogs due to crushing by off-road vehicles has been reported from other countries, there are few such reports from Australia. The Dwarf Green Tree Frog 'Litoria fallax' (Salientia: Hylidae) is a small arboreal frog widespread in wetlands of the coastal plain and ranges of eastern Australia, south of Cape York Peninsula and north of the border of Victoria (Cogger 2014). There are also extralimital populations of 'L. fallax' in and around metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria (Anstis 2013). 'Litoria fallax' is frequently locally abundant in swamps and in bulrush ('Typha' spp., Typhaceae) beds, although it has undergone marked decline in recent decades in metropolitan Sydney, New South Wales, mostly due to massive urban residential development and consequent loss of habitat, but also to the practice of local government councils of persistent clearing of 'Typha' spp. from streams and water channels (author unpubl. data). This note documents mortality to late larval 'L. fallax' due to crushing in their ephemeral pools by illegal trail bike traffic in a reserved area.

N2  - The Burwood Campus of Deakin University is located approximately 15 km from Melbourne's Central Business District. The campus has a variety of plants including eucalypts and grevilleas. Eucalyptus species include 'E. sideroxylon' (Red Ironbark), 'Corymbia maculata' (Spotted Gum) and 'E. muellerana' (Yellow Stringy Bark). Many bird species frequent the campus and visit the various plants and I was curious as to whether there would be a difference in the number and types of birds visiting these three eucalypts. I examined three trees of each species at hourly intervals on 5, 6 August 2014, from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. I focused on four bird species, all native and common: Rainbow Lorikeet 'Trichoglossus haematodus', Noisy Miner 'Manorina melanocephala', Australian Magpie 'Cracticus tibicen' and Eastern Rosella 'Platycercus eximius'. Each bird belonged to a different foraging guild (Table 1) and I believed that tree visitation would be related to foraging motivation. Both 'C. maculata' and 'E. sideroxylon' were in flower at the time of my observations.

This paper describes 16 records of calling Giant Burrowing Frogs from four tributaries of the Mitchell River system in the Mount Alfred State Forest and Mitchell River National Park, Victoria. Stream condition was a major determinant of calling activity, with calling detected only in pools with no or slow flow, within first, second and fourth order streams, often with sandstone bases. Calling was not always closely associated with rainfall, and occurred across most seasons.

N2  - The occurrence of ethanol and yeasts capable of fermenting nectar within flowers of 'Grevillea' 'Robyn 'Gordon' and 'Eucalyptus sideroxylon' was investigated in an urban situation. Time of day proved crucial for collection of nectar from 'E. Sideroxylon'. Ethanol occurred in the nectar of both species but yeasts were cultured only from 'G.' 'Robyn Gordon'. 'Candida globosa' was identified and is known to ferment all sugars within nectar except xylose. Two species of non-fermenting 'Cryptococcus' also were identified including 'C. laurentii' which is known to colonise the bronchi of immune suppressed patients.

N2  - 'Hakea decurrens' (Proteaceae) is generally regarded as a strongly serotinous species, with woody follicles opening only after fire; however, field observations indicate that follicles do open in the absence of fire. This study examined whether premature follicle opening served as a bet-hedging regeneration strategy, by which plants could recruit during protracted inter-fire periods. Two follicle morphs were identified: a thinner 'slug', and a thicker, more robust 'snail'. 'Slug' morphs were always observed open, while 'snail' morphs varied in the proportion of open follicles across several study areas with differing time-since-fire, highlighting a moderate correlation between the number of open 'snail'-shaped follicles and older trees. The proportion of open follicles was compared with that of Hakea eriantha, a species which occurs in very similar vegetation types to H. decurrens. Fewer open follicles were observed in this species. There was no sign of successful H. decurrens recruitment during inter-fire periods, indicating that premature follicle opening is not reproductive bet-hedging. Lack of inter-fire recruitment, as well as observations of webbing and insect larvae within a majority of 'slug' follicles, led to the formation of a new hypothesis which highlights seed abortion and granivory as potential key drivers behind follicle dimorphism and premature follicle opening in 'H. decurrens'.

N2  - While visiting Uluru last year, Fred Bohner, Kathy Himbeck and I decided to do the Mutitjulu Waterhole walk. While we were taking our time birdwatching and enjoying the scenery of this sacred place, a pair of Pied Butcherbirds Cracticus nigrogularis were seen regularly taking food back to their nest. After observing these birds for a few minutes we walked further and caught up to a tour group from a well-known Australian/New Zealand bus tour company. Not wanting to walk through the group, as their tour leader was talking with them, we stood back and listened to her spiel. Our interest in what she was saying was heightened when she started referring to a white coating all over the leaves of some small saplings as 'bird vomit'. On a closer inspection, after the group had moved on, the 'vomit' was found to be the lerp casings of the nymph stages of psyllid insects. It was a heavy infestation on the sapling gums.

N2  - Many factors are reported to affect reproduction in bryophytes but studies on the response of sexual reproduction to logging are extremely rare and the authors know of none for Australia. This paper reports the seasonal changes in sex expression and phenological development across a post-logging chronosequence for four species. Three species, Rhaphidorrhynchium amoenum, Rhynchostegium tenuifolium and Wijkia extenuata, were pleurocarpous and one, Rosulabryum billarderii, was an acrocarpous species. Reproduction in pleurocarpous species is seldom investigated because of the difficulty of untangling individual stems. Sex expression in terms of the numbers of male and female stems, number of perichaetia and perigonia, number of archegonia, antheridia and sporophytes did not differ across the chronosequence, so it would appear that forest age did not affect reproductive phenology.

In this case, the discovery was unusual - an email with photograph was sent to Pat and Ed Grey via a friends group. The find was made by Marc Campobasso and, from Marc's photograph, the fungus was identified as the Green-staining Coral Ramaria abietina.

N2  - Feeding ecology in the Green Catbird 'Ailuroedus crassirostris', a primary frugivore of temperate and subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia, was investigated in the Illawarra rainforests over a five-year period. Fruit from 20 species of trees, shrubs and climbers was identified in the diet, which comprised 25% of available fruiting species in the region. Bolwarra 'Eupomatia laurina', Brown Beech 'Pennantia cunninghamii' and Featherwood 'Polyosma cunninghamii' were the most important feed species. Sandpaper Fig 'Ficus coronata' was moderately exploited, although figs were not as important in the local diet as they were in the northern part of the species' range. Seven fruiting plants were new additions to the known diet, as were sections of Lantana 'Lantana camara' stems. Knowledge of Green Catbird diet at regional scales improves the assessment of suitable habitat and assists rainforest restoration by identifying priority plant species that benefit catbirds.

N2  - In 2014, the Fauna Survey Group of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria undertook a fauna survey in the Yarrara area in far north-western Victoria. Although this was a general survey, of particular interest were the White-browed Treecreeper and Major Mitchell's Cockatoo. The surveys included bird counts along 15 transects previously established for the monitoring of the treecreeper population, as well as three pitfall lines, the use of Elliott traps, harp traps, remote cameras and active searching. Ninety-five vertebrate species were detected, including 10 species listed under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, either as an individual species or part of a listed community. Over 50 detections of White-browed Treecreeper were recorded. There were no detections of Major Mitchell's Cockatoo. Four specimens of Little Pied Bat were captured and released. This species had not previously been recorded in the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas and is listed as endangered in South Australia and vulnerable in New South Wales. The survey helped to document the vertebrate faunal composition of this area and added new species to existing lists for the Yarrara, Mallanbool and Meringur Flora and Fauna Reserves. The results highlight the important role that smaller conservation reserves play in conserving biodiversity in the Mallee landscape. The Victorian Naturalist 133 (1), 2016, 10-20)

N2  - In December 2014, the African Carder bee 'Afranthidium (Immanthidium) repetitum' was collected from a garden in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. This is the first record of this exotic species for Victoria. First introduced to Australia in south-east Queensland in 2000, the species has undergone a massive range expansion since this time. The introduction of this bee may result in the proliferation and spread of environmental weeds in Victoria, and ongoing monitoring is required to determine the extent of its distribution. Behavioural observations are required to determine the potential impacts it may have on native bee and weed populations.

N2  - Victoria's largest trees occur in the high rainfall, wet sclerophyll forests of Southern Victoria. Reaching heights of over 90 m and girths of 20 m they are of cultural, historical and scientific importance. Once relatively common in the mid to late 19th century, land clearing, logging and frequent fires over the past 160 years have greatly reduced their number. The objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive survey of the location and condition of Victoria's remaining giant trees. A further objective was to raise the public profile of giant trees in Victoria. This work highlights the importance of forest management practices, including fire protection, which can impact on the survival of Victoria's largest trees.

N2  - The microhabitat of sympatric Eastern Blue-tongued Lizard 'Tiliqua scincoides' and Blotched Blue-tongued Liz ard T. nigrolutea was recorded along the Yarra River in suburban Melbourne. The habitat within a one metre radius of 20 'T. scincoides' and more than 23 'T. nigrolutea' was compared to the habitat available at the study sites. The habitat within one metre of 'T. nigrolutea' was almost all native tussock grasses, under or close to bushes and often under River Red Gums Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The habitat within one metre of T. scincoides was much more varied, including impervious surfaces, gardens and introduced grasses. Disproportionately few Tiliqua spp. were found in floodplain E. camaldulensis without tussock grasses. Individuals of each species were recorded within close proximity of each other. It is plausible that 0.5 ha of grassy woodland might be sufficient to sustain a population of T. nigrolutea. 'T. nigrolutea' appeared to be more common where domestic dogs were prohibited.

N2  - This survey is part of a continuing partnership between Parks Victoria and the Fauna Survey Group of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, to assist with the monitoring of priority biodiversity in Victorian parks and reserves. Biodiversity monitoring is an essential activity in that it provides important information that drives management decision-making. Limited resources and the large number of reserves in the State make it difficult to obtain and update relevant knowledge. Arboreal mammals are prominent in conservation rating systems such as the lists developed under the 'Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988'. The Grampians area is a known habitat for one such mammal, the Squirrel Glider Petaurus norfolcensis. With some of the records nearly 30 years old, this survey was instigated to provide more recent data. The group used three techniques (remote cameras, hair funnels and spotlighting) to survey for the presence of the Squirrel Glider and other arboreal fauna. Eight arboreal mammal species were detected, with each technique detecting at least one species not detected by the others. Notable findings included the detection of a Squirrel Glider on two occasions at one site and the Brush-tailed Phascogale 'Phascogale tapoatafa' at two sites.

N2  - This paper provides a broad international and national context for the symposium's focus on the conservation of the Victorian mammal fauna. As with Australia generally, the Victorian mammal fauna has suffered rates of extinction that are unusually high by global standards. The main factors that have caused loss of Australia's land mammals are predation (by the introduced feral Cat and Red Fox) and changed fire regimes, although other factors are also implicated in declines for some species. There are reasonable grounds for hope that the ongoing decline in Victoria's mammal fauna can be stemmed and reversed, especially because it is plausible to return, with intensive management, many of the 14 mammal species that have been extirpated from Victoria but have persisted elsewhere.

N2  - There's nothing quite like a scenic drive along a tree-lined highway. Majestic eucalypts stand sentry like a guard of honour. As passengers gazing out the car window, we might not think of these narrow, highway-side reserves as prime habitat for wildlife. Yet in many landscapes across Victoria, 'roadside reserves' are all that remains of the pre-European woodland vegetation. This poses the question: If the only habitat left occurs along roadsides, what does this mean for wildlife? I discussed this issue at the Mammals of Victoria seminar hosted by the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria in March 2015, with particular reference to woodland mammals.

N2  - The severe impacts of the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 on Leadbeater's Possum 'Gymnobelideus leadbeateri' populations has escalated the urgency to implement effective conservation measures for this species. This has been reflected in the positions of both the Victorian and Australian Governments, where more actions are being implemented for the species than at any previous time. However, significant debate still surrounds the most effective suite of actions required to conserve the species, and several reports highlight the need to implement stronger protection measures. The following paper provides a short outline of key developments over recent years and the major actions currently underway to conserve Leadbeater's Possum. Appendix 1 provides a bibliography listing key publications from 2012-2016.

N2  - The mainland subspecies of Eastern Barred Bandicoot is extinct in the wild due to fox predation and habitat loss, but has been successfully reintroduced into several predator-fenced reserves within its former range. In the 27 years since the Eastern Barred Bandicoot Recovery Team was formed, there have been reintroduction successes and failures. Importantly, there have been lessons learnt, and now this multi-agency recovery team has an ambitious plan to move Eastern Barred Bandicoot conservation from simply preventing extinction to recovering and down-listing the mainland subspecies. Over the next five years the recovery team is planning to roll out projects involving fences, islands and guardian dogs. Some projects are novel and may not succeed, but if two are successful, we stand a good chance of recovering this subspecies from near extinction and removing the Eastern Barred Bandicoot from the threatened species list.

N2  - This paper summarises some preliminary findings on the utilisation of narrow linear strips of habitat by the endangered Southern Brown Bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in the former Koo Wee Rup Swamp region of south-central Victoria. Results from trapping and radio-tracking at six linear sites revealed that bandicoots can occur in relatively high numbers, breed and live as long-term residents in narrow strips of vegetation, even when these occur in close proximity to residential areas. Some individuals also made use of food and nesting resources in the surrounding matrix. This study highlights the adaptability of the Southern Brown Bandicoot and emphasises the value of linear habitats to conserve this species in an otherwise highly modified landscape. It also lends weight to the possibility of using linear strips of habitat to accommodate the species in newly urbanising areas and potentially to maintain connectivity with adjacent sub-populations.

N2  - The number of mammal species recorded in Victoria continues to increase since European settlement, from less than 40 prior to 1850 to over 160 in 2014. The increases have been due to introductions of exotic species, discovery of new species either by new surveying techniques, opportunistic sightings and taxonomic classification often involving DNA analysis. Twenty-eight species are no longer found in Victoria, including eight native species that have become extinct, 16 natives no longer found here and four introduced species. Many of our remaining native fauna are threatened due to the continued impacts from introduced fauna or those of humans.

N2  - The Large Brown Tree Frog Litoria littlejohni is one of several poorly known threatened amphibian species in Victoria. We report recent findings on L. littlejohni, assess its current conservation status in Victoria, review information on its biology and identify potential threats that may have contributed to its apparent decline. Extensive searches in recent years have located 'L. littlejohni' at only four sites in East Gippsland, suggesting that this species has undergone a severe decline. Threats to this species include timber harvesting and associated forest management practices, changed fire regimes and infection by the amphibian fungus 'Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis'. In 2014, the Victorian Government released a Flora and Fauna Guarantee Action Statement for 'L. littlejohni', intended to ensure conservation of the species; inadequacies in the Action Statement are identified.

N2  - Recordings of frog calls made in the Melbourne suburb of Blackburn, Victoria, in 1971-1972 were identified and compared with calls heard in the same area in 2015. Although five species were heard in 1971-1972, only three were heard in 2015. 'Litoria ewingii' and 'Limnodynastes tasmaniensis' were present in both years, while three species 'Crinia signifera, Geocrinia victoriana' and 'Limnodynastes dumerilii' had disappeared by 2015. One additional species, 'Limnodynastes peronii', was present in 2015. The area has been extensively revegetated since 1971 and is now managed by the local Council as an urban bushland park, the Blackburn Creeklands.

N2  - Urbanisation represents one of the most intensive, globally pervasive and largely irreversible sets of changes to natural and other terrestrial and freshwater environments, in which many ecologically specialised species suc cumb to pressures from widespread and adaptable generalists, including invasive aliens. Direct habitat loss and degradation, leading to fragmentation and isolation of populations, demonstrates the importance of remnant natural vegetation or wetland, and the dependence of numerous taxa on manipulated 'green spaces' within ur ban areas. Insect assemblages, and many individual species, depend on the resources available in such enclaves, and their connectivity within the wider urban landscape. The conservation of selected Australian Lepidoptera species illustrates the practicalities of attempting to conserve individual ecological specialists within urban environments. Three contrasting species (the Eltham copper butterfly 'Paralucia pyrodiscus lucida'; Richmond birdwing butterfly 'Ornithoptera richmondia'; Golden sun-moth 'Synemon plana') represent different urban threat scenarios, contexts and needs. Each is a notable flagship species for urban conservation and the focus of continuing conservation effort. The programs are compared to suggest wider needs for conserving threatened insects within urban landscapes.

N2  - Fire is an important driver of ecosystem structure and function in Australia, and the study of these interrelationships has seen the development of a strong fire ecology discipline across the nation. Nowhere has this been stronger than in Victoria, which over the past 30 years has seen the refinement of an adaptive and innovative fire ecology framework, and its implementation and testing within an evolving policy setting and through a monitoring, evaluation and reporting framework. This paper outlines the key historical aspects of this rapidly evolving discipline within Victoria.

Mortality and mobidity are not frequently observed, reported or investigated so we have limited understanding of baseline wildlife health patterns. Disease in endemic wildlife has occurred because of introduced plants, spill over of infections from introduced domestic and feral animals, and from non-infectious diesease agents from urban development, industry, mining and agriculture. Wildlife Health Surveillance Victoria undertakes general wildlife disease surveillance, receives reports of wildlife health events to investigate and reports to Wildlife Health Australia.

N2  - The Golden Sun moth 'Synemon plana' is a diurnal moth listed as critically endangered in Australia. Many small reserves have been retained on Melbourne's outer north and western fringes to protect this species and its formerly extensive native grassland habitat. The moth exhibits synchronised emergence, presumably in part to achieve predator satiation. During population surveys for this species, staff from Merri Creek Management Committee observed two impacts relating to the urban context of two reserves: bird predation enhanced by an artificial density of perches and, misdirected breeding behaviour towards broken glass fragments resulting in futile breeding effort and greater vulnerability to predation. Mitigation measures to reduce these threats are identified and an observation on the application of one of these measures is reported.

I knew it could not be a real bird-dropping, because the location was inaccessible to the rear end of any bird that could produce a dropping that size. While investigating, I saw the lump move: it was a female Birddropping spider Celaenia excavata.

N2  - The Eastern Dwarf Tree Frog 'Litoria fallax' (Peters) (Anura: Hylidae) is a small (25 mm snout-vent length) frog native to coastal and adjacent areas from central-eastern Queensland to southern NSW (Tyler and Knight 2011). It inhabits vegetation, particularly reeds and floating plants, in and beside small creeks, dams, lagoons and swamps (Cogger 2014). Its preference for sheltering in the leaf-axils of pandanus, banana and pineapple plants, often well away from water (Cogger 2014) and within urbanised environments (Hodgkison et al. 2007), means this species is frequently transported, along with horticultural products and fresh fruit, to cities and towns outside its known natural range (Gillespie and Clemann 2000). For example, 'L. fallax' has been transported to Guam in the tropical western Pacific Ocean where it has established a breeding population (Christy et al. 2007). In Australia, it was recorded in 1999 outside its natural range from a sand quarry in Moorabbin, Melbourne (Gillespie and Clemann 2000). It has since been recorded in other Melbourne suburbs including Manningham East, Heidelberg, Kew and Melton, where, in some areas, it has established breeding populations (ALA 2015). Its persistence in Melbourne is believed to be facilitated by the 'heat island' effect, where minimum winter temperatures are higher than those of surrounding rural areas (Hamer and McDonnell 2010), thus providing a suitable breeding environment.

N2  - Eastern Brown Snake 'Pseudonaja textilis' (Serpentes: Elapidae) is a large diurnal terrestrial snake widely distributed in eastern mainland Australia, with an isolated population in the Northern Territory (Cogger 2014). In native habitats it typically occupies cavities beneath rocks and in fallen logs, in some areas deep cracks in dry soil, but readily exploits discarded anthropogenic materials, such as building debris, as refugia in rural and urban landscapes (pers. obs.).

N2  - The occurrence of juvenile Eastern Brown Snakes Pseudonaja textilis textilis with body bands from Werribee-Keilor plains grasslands near Melbourne is documented and a literature review of the variation in banding patterns across the species' geographic range is examined through published descriptions and photographs. The frequency of banded juveniles from Werribee - Keilor plains was 18% (n = 7) and the number of body bands ranged from 10 to 60. The number of body bands on Victorian juveniles was generally smaller ( < = 55) than the number of bands on juveniles from NSW (55+) (n = 38). Overall, the number of body bands ranged from 2 to approximately 90, they were typically 1 to 2 dorsal scale lengths in width, and the occurrence of incomplete bands was widespread and reasonably common (43%; n = 16).

N2  - Surveys of vertebrate fauna of the Eumeralla section of the Great Otway National Park in southern Victoria were carried out between March 2004 and March 2015. Twenty species of mammals were recorded, including several species listed as threatened or near threatened under Victorian and Federal legislation. These were Southern Brown Bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus, Swamp Antechinus Antechinus minimus maritimus, White-footed Dunnart Sminthopsis leucopus and Eastern Pygmy Possum Cercartetus nanus. Results from these surveys show the importance of long-term studies and confirm high biodiversity for this section of this important national park.

N2  - In 2014 and 2015, botanical surveys were undertaken at Hattah Lakes, Hattah-Kulkyne National Park, in semi-arid north-western Victoria, to study the response of understorey vegetation to a strategic environmental watering event. During the surveys, 23 plant species listed on the Victorian Government Advisory List of Rare and Threatened Species were recorded; with two of these species also listed under the 'Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988' (Vic). Four of these species were recorded for the first time in the Park, and for a further 11 species the number of records were, at least, doubled within the Park. The 23 rare species represented five Water Plant Functional Groups. The cover of two functional groups and two species were significantly different before and after inundation. Although species and functional group responses to inundation differed, a key outcome from this study was the increase in rare species records for Hattah-Kulkyne National Park.

N2  - The Hooded Plover 'Thinornis cucullatus' is an Australian endemic shorebird, inhabiting high energy, sandy coastlines along southern Australia. The eastern population is declining in range and number. Hooded Plovers face threats including human disturbance (pedestrian traffic, vehicles) and dogs. Tasmania, with its extensive ocean beaches, is considered a stronghold for the species, yet much suitable habitat is remote and infrequently surveyed. Lack of understanding of Hooded Plover distribution and abundance can impede effective management of the species and its threats. We surveyed over 43 km of Tasmania's western coastline for Hooded Plovers to contribute towards knowledge of the species in the region, comparing results with a survey conducted in 2002. Eighty-nine Hooded Plovers were recorded at a density of 3.36 birds per km of beach habitat. To protect the high density of Hooded Plovers on this coast, it will be necessary for management agencies to mitigate prevailing threats.

We describe three observations of attacks on birds, including one on a Striated Heron 'Butorides striata' that was struck in the air and survived after being washed ashore. Incidents of White-bellied Sea-Eagles catching a Silver Gull 'Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae' and an Australian Raven 'Corvus coronoides' chick are presented. The remains of Silver Gulls and Little Pied Cormorants 'Microcarbo melanoleucos' were identified at a regular butchering post after an eagle was located with a freshly killed gull.

N2  - Maremma guardian dogs have been protecting Little Penguins Eudyptula minor from canid predation at Middle Island, Warrnambool, since 2006. Foxes had preyed heavily on the penguins contributing to a population crash - from over 500 arrivals in the 1999-2000 breeding season, to less than 10 some five years later. Our monitoring of arrivals indicates numbers have grown to over 100 penguins. The successful use of guardian dogs to protect native wildlife and the strong community participation and support for the program constitutes what has become known as the 'Warrnambool Method' for wildlife conservation management.

N2  - Humans have been installing nest boxes for hollow-dependent fauna for decades. These boxes provide nest sites for a range of birds and arboreal mammals where natural tree hollows may be scarce. Large species require large hollows and in recent years, a number of large nest boxes have been trialled for the largest species of Australian forest owl, the Powerful Owl 'Ninox strenua'. This paper reports communal denning in one such nest box by two sympatric, large species of gliding possum, the Greater Glider 'Petauroides volans' and Yellow-bellied Glider 'Petaurus australis'.

N2  - Observations and data on the appearance, size, habits, behaviour and reproduction of the semi-fossorial Bougainville's Skink 'Lerista bougainvillii' from basalt plains grasslands near Melbourne are described. Lizards were active on the ground surface at night (and also cryptically by day) but were otherwise located singly beneath stones on loam soil. Significantly more lizards were located beneath stones from October to March compared with April to September. Juveniles and sub-adults were rarely encountered. Gravid females were located only in summer, eggs from late January to early March and post-ovipositional females from mid-January through to early March. Clutch size ranged from 1 to 4 eggs (mode 3, n = 17) and eggs showed considerable variability in shape and size within and between clutches. There was no relationship between female size and clutch size, but in larger clutches eggs were generally shorter in length. Hatching occurred in late summer through to early autumn, and neonate average total length was 51.5 mm (n = 31). Artificial incubation took between 28 and 49 days. Tail autotomy in adults was high (63%). Adults in captivity showed vigorous aggression towards each other.

After subsequent collections by JH Willis and AC Beauglehole, MTM Rajput and RC Carolin used Willis's specimens to describe a new species in 1988 and named it in honour of Jean Galbraith.

N2  - Surveys for the threatened Brown Toadlet Pseudophryne bibronii were undertaken at Bald Hill Reserve near Kyneton from April to June 2016. Surveys employed the Amphibian Calling Index technique, and the species was detected at five sites in the Reserve. Peak activity occurred during April and May, while no P. bibronii were recorded calling in June. A full chorus of P. bibronii was recorded at two sites, which suggests this population is of a very large size. This may be one of the largest extant Victorian populations of P. bibronii, making it an important site for research and conservation of this threatened species.

N2  - The diet of the Powerful Owl 'Ninox strenua' is relatively well studied, particularly in the Melbourne area. Nevertheless, the opportunity was taken to collect 111 pellets, or partial pellets, regurgitated from birds at six sites across the Greater Melbourne area between April 2009 and February 2015. As expected from previous and more detailed studies, analysis of these pellets showed that Common Ringtail Possum 'Pseudocheirus peregrinus' was the most common prey, and occurred in 79 pellets. Two unexpected findings were Swamp Wallaby 'Wallabia bicolor' remains found in one pellet collected on Bourkes Creek, near the township of Emerald, and Little Red Flying-fox 'Pteropus scapulatus' remains in three owl pellets collected at a site on the lower Yarra River.

N2  - This article describes a record of the White-footed Dunnart Sminthopsis leucopus (Gray, 1842) north of the Shoalhaven River near Nowra in New South Wales in 1995. Two decades later this remains the most northerly record of 'S. leucopus' in New South Wales. The Nowra site was in dry open forest with very sparse understorey and ground cover, unlike the wetter, more heavily vegetated habitats where the species is typically found in Victoria.

N2  - A field survey of the freshwater fishes of the Bomaderry Creek catchment in 1994-1995 recorded nine native species and one introduced species. One of the species recorded, Climbing Galaxias 'Galaxias brevipinnis', is of conservation concern in New South Wales. A report of an additional four native species was obtained from secondary sources. A concrete weir on Bomaderry Creek was found to represent a discontinuity in the distribution of some fish species. Four out of the six diadromous species recorded in the field survey were found only below the weir, while the two potamodromous species recorded were both found above and below the weir. The subsequent decommissioning of this weir in 1998 may substantially increase the potential habitat available for diadromous fish species in the Bomaderry Creek catchment.

N2  - The Daddy Long-legs spider, also known as the Cellar spider or Long-bodied Cellar spider, was first recorded for science 242 years ago by Swiss entomologist Johann Kaspar Fussli, as 'Pholcus phalangioides (Fuesslin, 1775)', and was the only spider he described (Wikipedia website). This species is believed to have been introduced to Australia (Walker 'et al.' 2003) from Europe (Main 1976) and is often referred to as 'cosmopolitan' (e.g. Mascord 1980; Uhl 1998).
