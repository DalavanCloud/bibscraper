The data on the morphology of Southern Fulmar and two Fulmar subspecies are used as the basis for this study. Bill length and width in Pacific and Atlantic Fulmar and in other Procellariiformes (one specimen from each genus) were examined. The structure of jaw apparatus muscles, especially m. adductor externus profunda, pars caudalis (Aec), gives evidence for the conclusion that in Pacific Fulmar (F. glacialis rotgersii) this structure is more archaic. The aponeurotic construction of Aec in F. g. rodgersii is similar to that in Albatroses and Petrels, the most ancient birds in Procellariiformes. Paleontological data confirm this conclusion. Comparison of paleontological, paleoclimatic and paleogeographical data allows approximate origination time of Southern Fulmar in South Pacific to be determined: late Miocene – early Pliocene.

Many similar morphological features (head structure; presence of an intestine and gut diverticle; ventral ganglion; lateral fins flattened in dorso-ventral direction; grasping spines, and spermatophores) allow consideration of euconodonts as animals similar to Chaetognatha. However, such features as terminal position of mouth and anus, and the differences of the tooth apparatus structure give every reason to distinguish euconodonts as an independent phylum, Euconodontophylea. Unique fine structure of the muscular tissue and the structure of the intercellular contacts may indicate early separation of Chaetognatha from the common stem of Metazoa and commencement of original pathway of tissue perfection with preservation of the minimum organ amount.

A summary of 435 records of the species in northwestern Europe from 1951 to 1995 is given along with a map of the vast northern area of vagrancy. Birds were recorded over an eight-month period, from late March to the 2nd ten days of November. Sex and age composition of vagrants, range of frequency in various years and seasons were analyzed. The principial factors that caused the increase in the number of northern vagrants over the last 45 years include the increased number of observers and the general rise in mean annual temperature in the northern hemisphere. The “overshooting” of migrating individuals in spring anticyclonic conditions, the vagrancy of unsuccessful breeders, and the post-juvenile dispersal affect mainly the frequency of vargants in various years. There are no indications that the total population size has increased or that a northward expansion has occurred. Most vagrants presumably die of starvation or become victims of carnivores and birds of prey. The probability of nesting in places well beyond the normal breeding range is quite small even for single pairs.","2410-0226","6eccadc318046800c3f07e376e59f8aa");

The combination of all characters allows us to divide M. nivalis into 19 subspecies, including M. nivalis rossica subsp. n. (Eastern Europe). The Egyptian weasel (M. subpalmata) is regarded by us as a separate species. Large long-tailed weasels with coloration of “nivalis”-type (group numidica) are probably closest to the ancestral type of M. nivalis. Small weasels (group nivalis) appeared later, probably in the boreal regions of the Palaearctic. These weasels could have penetrated North America through Beringia. Another form (vulgaris-boccamela) was formed during the Late Pleistocene in the eastern Mediterranean from numidica.

Ivanov, body somites are formed in two ways, by segmentation of the germinal bands and by the activity of the growth zone. The growth zone appears posterior to the 4th postantennualar somite and divides the body into 2 parts, the group of anterior protosomites (anterior to the growth zone) and the group of posterior protosomites (posterior to the growth zone). The somites formed by the growth zone (eusomites) are disposed between the anterior and posterior groups of protosomites. The precise position of the growth zone may be confirmed by the study of concentrations of mitoses. Sometimes one may determine the position of the growth zone by the loss of at least one eusomite and its limbs behind the anterior protosomite and its limbs, or by a variability in the number of thoracic somites (as in Branchiopoda). The number of trunk somites may be reduced by halting early the segmentation of the hind part of the germinal bands and/or the activity of the growth zone.   On the basis of the number of trunk somites, Maxillopoda are usually subdivided into 2 groups. The first group have 22 trunk somites including the telson: Copepoda, Ascothoracida, Mystacocarida, Skaracarida (Skara as an exception with 12 trunk somites), Facetotecta with no more than 10 trunk somites including the telson, and certain ostracodan groups (Myodocopida, Cylindroleberididae, Platycopida, Cytherellidae). The second group have only 4-7 trunk somites (including the telson): Branchiura, Cirripedia, and Podocopida among Ostracoda. Tantulocarida are very similar to Copepoda in the structure of adult males and tantulus larvae, differing only in secondary characters: fusion of 2 (not 1) somites with the cephalosome and fusion of urosomal somites posterior to genital one. The development of Mystacocarida (a representative of the first group) demonstrates that the 1th-3rd trunk somites are formed by the growth zone. The coincidence in the number of trunk somites among most members of the first group leads me to conclude that 3 eusomites are present in all taxa of that group. Development in Cirripedia and Branchiura demonstrates the absence of eusomites inasmuch as all the definitive somites appear simultaneously during the molt to the cypris larva. The incomplete homology of trunk somites together with other characters leads me to regard these 2 groups as the classes Ascothoraciodes and Halicyniodes in the recently proposed classification of the Crustacea (Starobogatov, 1988); these names have priority over other ones. This does not exclude the hypothesis of a common ancestor for both of the above-mentioned classes, nor for the Crustacea as a whole.","2410-0226","5908ab527b52fc7ff8c79cd17f0a2cbc");

A trait combination that includes coloration of upperparts, upper wing coverts, throat spot, and rectrices was shown to be highly useful for diagnosing age, sex, and subspecies. In subspecies, five plumages are described in detail: juvenile, first winter, first summer, winter, and summer plumages of adults. Also, within-group and between-group variation of nine linear measurements in L. p. ballioni (n = 73) and L. p. tschebaiewi (n = 72) was studied. Canonical variate analysis suggests that these subspecies differ not just in generaln size (L. p. tschebaiewi is larger), but in wing shape as well: in L. p. ballioni the wing top is more pointed. Overall, the results of the multivariate analysis suggest that age-and-sex variation in these measurements within the two subspecies is 2.7 times lower than is the difference between them. Apparently three levels of within-species variation may be separated: (a) the closest subspecies are L. p. pectoralis and L. p. ballioni; (b) L. p. confusa is a well-differentiated subspecies; and (c) L. p. tschebaiewi is even more distinct and may be regarded as a megasubspecies sensu Amadon & Short (1976).","2410-0226","8f8ee3a8006eaa8aa2af73f2f44cb92b");

Plesiomorph-apomorph polarities of cuticle sculpture, cephalic sensilla pattern, amphid shape are revealed with use of the out-group comparison and ontogenetic observations. The genera Ceramonema and Pselionema are distinguished by the most apomorph character states; both genera combined comprise the greatest number of species, of the widest overall ecological range. The other ceramonematid genera display more plesiomorph character states and contain much less speces; these are strictly confined to coars sand. Ceramonematidae are related to the families Diplopeltoididae sensu Tchesunov (1990) and Tarvaiidae. The family Ceramonematidae consists of two subfamilies: Ceramonematidae with the genera Ceramonema (= Ceramonemoides, = Cyttaronema), Dasynemella (=Leptodasynemella), Dasynemoides (=Dasynemelloides), Metadasynemella (=Dictyonemella), and Metadasynemoides, and Pselionematinae with the genera Pterygonema and Pselionema (= Pselionemoides). Modified diagnoses of the family, subfamilies and genera are given. Separation of higher ceramonematid taxa is based largely on features of body cuticle annulation as well as on anterior sensilla pattern, while cephalic ratio and finer details of body annulation are important for species discriminaton. Annotated lists of species are given for each genus. The genus Ceramonema is subdivided into two subgenera, Ceramonema s. str. (body cuticular annules with zygapophyses) and Proceramonema subg. n. (body annules devoid of zygapophyses). New species from the With Sea (Ceramonema fluctuosum sp. n., C. marisalbi sp. n., C. mokievskii sp. n., Dasynemoides crassus sp. n., Metadasynemoides labiatus sp. n., Pselionema concinnum sp. n., P. mirabile sp. n.) are described.

The new species, Gammanema anthostoma sp. n., is distinguished by the peculiar chelostomal rugae protruding from the mouth. Its males differ from the males of all Gammanema species in the lack of supplementary organs. Females of G. anthostoma sp. n. differ from those of the two Gammanema species whose males are hitherto unknown: from the females of G. mediterraneum Vitieello, 1970 in the lacking long somatic setae, value of the b index and three times longer body; and from females of G. cancellatum Gerlach, 1955 in the lenth ratio of the outer labial and cephalic setae. Six swpecies (Choniolaimus panicus, Gammanema fennicum, G. rapax, Halichoanolaimus robustus, Latronema aberrans, Richthersia inaequalis) are recorded from the White Sea for the first time. G. fennicum is ressurected as a good species and its male is described for the first time; this species is strongly sexually dimorphic. G. rapax is a very variable species or even a group of species, as its redescriptions differ in important details: its wide distribution needs confirmation. In males of Latronema aberrans, the spermatozoa are filiform unlike rounded spermatozoa of other selachinematids.","2410-0226","9840b84c7ed3e2d8de816581549a4467");

(Russia). The identity of these structures in morphology and ontogenetic stages testifies that all of them belong to euconodonts. The rounded head structures of euconodonts, or H elements (Buryi & Kasatkina, 2001), appear to be analogous to the skeletal attaching plates of Chaetognatha. They were arranged in pairs in the anterior part of head in front of the tooth apparatus symmetrically to the sagittal axis of the euconodont and their surface was completely coated with a soft connective-muscular tissue like a cap. The H skeletal elements are rather a part of the mouth assemblage of euconodont animals along with the pharynx, P, M, and S elements of the tooth apparatus, and muscles (connective-muscular tissue). The presence of skeletal attaching plates (H elements) in euconodonts is responsible for the unique structure of the head part and of the whole animal (the euconodont mouth is arranged along the sagittal axis between the H elements). This supports recognition of these animals as a separate type, Euconodontophylea (Kasatkina & Buryi, 1999).","2410-0226","9a4ed72a111491927fa38feae000bfe8");

Pesenko","2004","The phylogeny and classification of the tribe Halictini, with special reference to the Halictus genus-group (Hymenoptera: Halictidae)","Zoosystematica Rossica","13","1","83","113","The monophyly of the cosmopolitan tribe Halictini, including over 2300 currently recognized species, is supported by at least a single manifested synapomorphy shared by all members of the tribe: metasomal tergum VII of the male is modified; this forms a transverse ridge giving a false apex beneath which the tergum is strongly reflexed to the morphological posterior margin. On the basis of the present phylogenetic analysis, the tribe Halictini is subdivided into five subtribes: Halictina (comprised of 7 genera: Echthralictus, Glossodialictus, Halictus, Homalictus, Patellapis, Seladonia, and Thrincohalictus), Sphecodina (4 genera: Eupetersia, Microsphecodes, Ptilocleptis, and Sphecodes), Thrinchostomina (2 genera: Thrinchostoma and Parathrincostoma), Caenohalictina (9 genera: Agapostemon, Caenohalictus, Dinagapostemon, Habralictus, Mexalictus, Paragapostemon, Pseudagapostemon, Rhinetula, and Ruizantheda), and Gastrohalictina (one large and diverse genus: Lasioglossum s. l.). The subtribe Halictina is a paraphyletic group; the remaining four tribes are strictly monophyletic (holophyletic).

  The monophyly of the Halictus genus-group, comprising the genera Halictus and Seladonia, is supported by two distinct synapomorphies of the male genitalia: (1) dorsal gonostylus simple (not double), flattened, broad, narrowed proximally, and provided with a clump of very coarse bristles on the inner surface; (2) ventral gonostylus sclerotized, relatively thin and long, directed backward. Only generalized members of the group possess both the character states above. In derived members, the clump of bristles and the ventral gonostylus are often lost independently. The sister group of the Halictus genus-group is the genus Thrincohalictus. This is supported by the following synapomorphy found among the tribe Halictini only in Halictus, Seladonia, and Thrincohalictus: the ventral gonobasal rim in the male genitalia is forming a right posterolateral angle with a short projection directed laterally. Another feature characterizing these three genera is the presence (except in the parasitic subgenus Paraseladonia) of posterior bands of tomentum or dense and much plumose appressed hairs on the metasomal terga. However, this character is shared also with Patellapis subgenera Patellapis and Lomatalictus.

  The following subgeneric classification of the genera Halictus and Seladonia is suggested. The genus Halictus includes 12 subgenera: Acalcaripes (2 species), Argalictus (8), Halictus s. str. (4), Hexataenites (11), Lampralictus (1), Monilapis (29), Nealictus (2), Odontalictus (2), Platyhalictus (14), Protohalictus (13), Ramalictus (2), and Tytthalictus (4). The genus Seladonia comprises 6 subgenera, including 2 new ones: Mucoreohalictus subg. n. (15), Pachyceble (22), Paraseladonia (1), Placidohalictus subg. n. (5), Seladonia s. str. (36), and Vestitohalictus (16). The subgenera of Halictus and Seladonia are keyed. The phylogenetic tree of the subgenera of Halictus and Seladonia is reconstructed with use of 46 morphological characters of adults. All other genera of the tribe Halictini were taken as outgroup. The genus Halictus is ascertained as a strictly monophyletic group based upon a single postulated synapomorphy: dorsal gonostylus with a triangular hair patch as a distal appendage on inner side. All the subgenera of this genus appear as strictly monophyletic groups, with the exception of Monilapis, which is a paraphyletic one in relation to Acalcaripes. The monophyly of the genus Seladonia is supported by three synapomorphies, including a novelty (unique synapomorphy): male dorsal gonostylus with a deep cleft. All the subgenera of this genus are strictly monophyletic with the exception of Placidohalictus, which is a paraphyletic one in relation to Vestitohalictus and Mucoreohalictus. A synonymical catalogue of species and species-group names in the genera Halictus and Seladonia, including 442 names, is provided as an appendix.

All three forms steadily differ from each other in the coloration patterns, while the dimensional parameters are greatly overlapping. The birds with intermediate features of inornatus x humei were found out to be rather numerous in their spatial contact zone. Their total number turned to be less than the number of phenotypically “pure” humei, but more than that of inornatus, while according to literature the individuals with intermediate type of song have never been recorded so far. Hence, we suppose that the hybrid birds inherit the song of either one or another form. Therefore the conclusion about species status of inornatus and humei appears to be rather ungrounded because it was based only on the results of vocalization analysis without examining of collection.

Scott, 1909), collected in the central and northwestern Pacific for the first time, are presented. The diagnostic significance of the setation of the maxillules, maxillae and maxillipeds in Scolecitrichidae, Tharybidae and Diaixidae is analyzed. The proportions of maxillule expressed as indices showing length or width of its different parts in relation to the width of the first inner lobe are proposed here as the main distinguishing characters separating Scolecitrichidae and Tharybidae, more informative than some diagnostic features of its setation. The relationships between the Bradfordian families and between sections of the family Scolecitrichidae are discussed, mainly on the basis of setation of the maxilla and maxilliped. The systematic positions of A. aspinosa and the genera Heteramalla, Puchinia, Cenognatha, Plesioscolecithrix, Rythabis and Parkius are discussed. A detailed comparative analysis of characters of the genus Heteramalla is provided. Heteramalla and Puchinia belong to the group of early offshoots of the family Scolecitrichidae, not to the central core, where they were placed by Ohtsuka with coauthors (2003) and by Boxshall & Hulsey (2004). Rythabis has the setation of maxillule closer to the ancestral type common to all Bradfordian families, but the proportions of maxillule typical to Tharybidae. Since the indices of maxillule do not overlap in Scolecitrichidae and Tharybidae, and the maxillule and other mouthparts show different evolutionary trends of specialization, Rythabis is considered as a member of the Tharybidae, where it was placed by Schulz (in Schulz & Beckmann, 1995). Parkius has the proportions of the maxillule intermediate between those in Scolecitrichidae and Tharybidae and unique apomorphic features recorded earlier by Ferrari & Markhaseva (1996). These unique progressive features of Parkius can be a result of important biological transformations, compared with the other Bradfordian families; therefore the status of the separate family Parkiidae, fam. dist., is restored. The male considered as Racovitzanus sp. (Grice & Hulsemann, 1967) actually belongs to Parkius. Swimming legs 5 of this male are peculiar, fitting those neither of Scolecitrichidae nor of Tharybidae. Their structure shows a separate evolutionary trend and also justifies the family status of Parkiidae.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2004/zr_2004_13_2_Vyshkvartzeva.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2004/zr_2004_13_2_Vyshkvartzeva.pdf");

Superficial body structures are for the first time recognized for euconodont animals: external rings (annulation) (Panderodus imprint) and their traces (specimens 2 and 3 from Granton). This makes them looking like many invertebrates, such as annelids, priapulids, or pentastomids, and different from primitive chordates. In all other imprints of euconodont animals, a deep frontal break reaching their central part uncovers the inner transversal structures of the body, muscular fibers. As in invertebrates, they have different orientation. The medial apices of the fibers can be directed obliquely towards either the head (specimens 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 from Granton, and Promissum pulchrum Kovacs-Endrődy imprints) or the tail (specimens 2 and 6 from Granton) or to be perpendicular to the body axis (specimens 3-5 from Granton). Discontinuity of the transversal structures (specimens 1 and 6) appears to occur in the euconodont animals. This suggests that the transversal obliquely-oriented structures visible on the euconodont imprints, are not myomers typical of chordate animals. Differently directed position of medial apices of the obliquely-oriented muscular fibers depends, probably, on physical state (direction of movement) of the animal. The longitudinal median structure, in our opinion, cannot be considered a chord, but is rather a gut extending from pharynx to anus. Apparently, in spite of visual similarity, the euconodont animals under study cannot be classified as chordates, or chaetognaths, or pentastomids. Their muscular system differs from that of all known groups of animals and shows its own unique structure: its inner transversal structures are muscular fibers, which externally look like rings (annulation). This supports our earlier conclusion (Kasatkina & Buryi, 1997) that euconodonts constitute a separate phylum, Euconodontophylea Kasatkina & Buryi, 1997.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2006/zr_2006_15_2_Kasatkina.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2006/zr_2006_15_2_Kasatkina.pdf");

The ICZN (2008) has responded in a timely manner by proposing the following amendment of the  fourth edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999) to allow electronic  publishing of new zoological names and nomenclatural acts coupled with (1) proper archiving of works  to ensure permanent conservation and access and (2) registration of new scientifi c names in open access  ICZN registry (i.e. ZooBank) to ensure that they are made widely known. The ICZN proposal also  addresses methods of publication in general, discusses the reasoning behind the proposal, and provides  explanations of the procedure for amendment and adoption of the proposal (Zhang, 2008).  The ICZN encourages comments from the community of zoologists as to whether they oppose, support,  or can suggest improvements and alternatives to the various parts of the proposal.  To facilitate the discussion on this important topic for zoological taxonomy, Zoosystematica rossica  also welcomes comments on the ICZN proposal.

We found that, in mature individuals (the 4th stage of maturation), the anterior parts of the testes are located in front of the posterior part of the ovaries. The anterior parts of the testes have a ventral position adjoining the ventral muscular bands. The ovaries are located more dorsally than the testes at the level of lateral fi elds. A transverse trunk-tail septum between testes and ovaries was not revealed. These data support an idea that a structure which was earlier treated as a tail-trunk septum is actually the anterior edges of the testes. Both longitudinal coelomic cavities continue into the tail region without any transverse septa. The paired tail cavities as can be seen from their composition and functions represent the testes consisting of a peripheral compact portion with undifferentiated germ cells and a space where the maturation of cells occurs. The tail is distinguished anatomically as a post-anal portion of the body but it is not a true segment as it is not separated from a trunk part of the body by the trunk-tail septum. The body of Chaetognatha consists of two true parts (segments). A mesenterial septum divides the body longitudinally-symmetrically from a trunk-head septum down only to the caudal end of the gut. In the tail region there is a medial septum formed by the medial walls of testes. Gonads in both females and males do not have any duct connecting them with a gut cavity. The ovaries and the testes are covered by a coelomic lining and a duct between the ovaries and the testes is absent.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2008/zr_2008_17_2_Kasatkina.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2008/zr_2008_17_2_Kasatkina.pdf");

Each element of the Bauplan can be described by a set of parameters, i.e., size, shape, structure, material composition and position. Though Bauplan is undoubtedly an abstraction, it is a necessary abstraction to be used in phylogenetic analysis with preference to \"ingroup\" and \"outgroup\" comparisons.The cranial osteology of black tetra Gymnocorymbus ternetzi (Boulenger, 1895) is described based on the study of larvae, juvenile and adult specimens.

ICA is often used for species’ delimitation and identification in different taxa of pulmonates, however, its variation (in both intra- and interspecific levels) is still poorly studied that may make troubles for systematicists. The variation of ICA in pond snails (family Lymnaeidae Rafinesque, 1815) has been studied in several aspects (intra- and interpopulation, interspecific). It has been shown that the index varies considerably, and it is almost impossible to identify a single specimen on the base of ICA solely. However, mean ICA values are more useful for taxonomic and identification purposes. Closely related species of lymnaeids demonstrate some extent of overlap between their ranges of ICA variation that hampers their identification but is not a cause for synonymisation. The factors of different origin that potentially may influence the ICA values in freshwater pulmonates have been reviewed. It is revealed that ICA manifests significant ontogenic and (in some lymnaeid species) geographical changes. The use of ICA in pulmonate systematics should be accompanied by data on variation in another characters of conchological or anatomical kind.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2011/zr_2011_20_1_Vinarski.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2011/zr_2011_20_1_Vinarski.pdf");

However, a regional checklist of Macrosiphini has not been published yet. Based on material preserved in our collections and data scattered across publications, we have compiled the first comprehensive list of Macrosiphini recorded from Belarus and briefly analysed it from the geographical and ecological points of view. The list includes 52 genera, 156 species and 2 subspecies. Acyrthosiphon cyparissiae (Koch, 1855), A. euphorbiae B&ouml;rner, 1949, Diuraphis (Holcaphis) frequens (Walker, 1848), Dysaphis angelicae (Koch, 1854), D. apiifolia petroselini (B&ouml;rner, 1950), D. lauberti (B&ouml;rner, 1940), Paramyzus heraclei B&ouml;rner, 1933, Macrosiphum melampyri Mordvilko, 1919, and Uroleucon pulicariae (Hille Ris Lambers, 1939) are recorded from Belarus for the first time. The recorded diversity is lower than in the adjacent countries – Poland and Latvia. In accordance with the global pattern of aphid relations with their host plants, the majority of Belarusian Macrosiphini species permanently inhabit herbaceous plants (monoecious species) or migrate to them from woody plants (dioecious species). Among the recorded species, 27 inhabit a single host plant species, 85 – plants of a single genus, 37 – plants of a single family, and only seven species inhabit host plants of several families or more. At least 16 species (10% of local fauna of Macrosiphini) are alien to Belarus.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2012/zr_2012_21_1_Buga.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2012/zr_2012_21_1_Buga.pdf");

There is not a single unique apomorphic character in the monotypic family Putoidae; all characters of the genus Puto Signoret, 1875 are plesiomorphies of all scale insects or synapomorphies with other mealybugs or with the closely related Ceroputo &#352;ulc, 1898.

It is considered a member of the superorder Coleopterida. It shares with the order Coleoptera sclerotised forewings, which demonstrate a simple and somewhat reduced Sc, a simple and concave RP, a convex RA, the M less convex than R and CuA, M also simple and basally fused with CuA (putative synapomorphy), but distally separating from it; stem of M+Cu well separated from R, the coxae do not project and the trochanters are short. The new order Skleroptera ordo nov. differs from the orders Coleoptera and Strepsiptera in the structure of the thoracic sclerites and venation of the forewings, particularly in the following character combination: the absence of lateral carina on the prothorax, the narrow separation of the bases of its forewings, the very narrow anal region of the forewings that widen apically and the absence of a sub-marginal anal (adsutural) vein going along the entire posterior margin of the tegmina. These unique characters of Stephanastus Kirejtshuk et Nel, 2013 suggest that this individual was somewhat laterally compressed (like some orthopteroids). This represents also an essential difference from body ground plan of the Coleoptera in general. It is hypothesized that the position of the new order within the superorder Coleopterida at the subclade level is as follows: Skleroptera + (Coleoptera [probably including Umenocoleidae sensu stricto] +Strepsiptera).","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2013/zr_2013_22_2_Kirejtshuk.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2013/zr_2013_22_2_Kirejtshuk.pdf");

Evolution of the copulatory apparatus in the suborder Ensifera and in its ancestors may be divided into three hypothetical stages reflected in some morphological features: 1) a highly hypothetical stage without copulation and without a copulatory apparatus in the most ancient (extinct) orthopteroid insects; 2) the appearance of different organs in early Orthoptera serving for fixation of partners during copulation and for insertion of the spermatophore in the female genital chamber; 3) the development of complicated organ with consolidation of these functions.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2014/zr_2014_23_2_Gorochov_1.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2014/zr_2014_23_2_Gorochov_1.pdf");

Part 2: Male genitalia in Grylloidea","Zoosystematica Rossica","24","1","31","41","In the superfamily Grylloidea, the main trends in the evolution of the copulatory apparatus were probably connected with the transformation of simple membranous (hagloid) genitalia, characteristic of ancient groups of Ensifera, into a complicated organ with highly specialized sclerites for fixation of the female during copulation. This evolutionary process was probably accompanied by partial reduction and disappearance of paraproctal hooks or other external abdominal processes which may have been used by these ancient groups for female fixation. Sclerites in the male genitalia of Grylloidea appeared independently not less than four times: in Gryllotalpidae, Myrmecophilidae, Gryllidae and Mogoplistidae. This hypothesis, proposed by Gorochov in 1984, was one of the reasons for division of the recent Grylloidea into four families. Each of the first three families acquired sclerites in the male genitalia once, whereas Mogoplistidae possibly acquired them more than once: male genitalia of the tribe Mogoplistini are of the hagloid type, membranous; in most genera of Arachnocephalini (Mogoplistinae), in Pseudomogoplistes (Mogoplistinae) and in Malgasiinae, male genitalia have three types of sclerites which could have also appeared independently. Moreover, many sclerites of the male genitalia in Grylloidea are formed independently and have significant convergent similarity; this is why the nomenclature of male genital structures based partly on their function and position but not exclusively on their homology is simpler and much more suitable for descriptions and morphological investigations. This nomenclature is considered here.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2015/zr_2015_24_1_ Gorochov_1.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2015/zr_2015_24_1_ Gorochov_1.pdf");

A similar structure is also described in one of the imprints from Granton (Great Britain) exposed from internal surfaces. A hypothesis is put forward on the mechanism of functioning of the feeding apparatus in euconodonts which consists of hard S, M, and P tooth elements and H attaching skeletal elements as well as soft connective structures. The food sac probably served for filtering food particles from the water which was removed through special openings and for formation of the food bolus and transferring the latter into the alimentary canal (gut). These data gave to reasons for a new interpretation of feeding behaviour of euconodonts. It is suggested that the euconodont animals were filter feeders adapted to the near-bottom dwelling over substrates, where there was greatest concentration of small food items available for filtration.","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2015/zr_2015_24_1_ Guravskaya.pdf","2410-0226","http://www.zin.ru/journals/zsr/content/2015/zr_2015_24_1_ Guravskaya.pdf");
