Journal starts out as

Wuhan zhi wu xue yan jiu = Journal of Wuhan botanical research

ISSN 1000-470X

Then becomes 

植物科学学报 Plant science journal

ISSN 2095-0837

WorldCat says took place from 2011, online archive has everything as "Plant science journal"
but PDFs before 2011 are Journal of Wuhan botanical research.

There look to be lots of possible DOIs missed, will need to investigate further.
