Norikura and Utsukushigahara, central Honshu of Japan. The stigma and anther heights considerably varied among the plants and each of the characters showed normal frequency distributions within populations. However, stigma-anther separation showed a bimodal distribution. Based on this floral character the populations concerned were tentatively divided into two discrete floral morphs : long (L)-styled morph and homo (H)-styled morph. Each of the two morphs was highly constant within a plant and did not change its floral nature for over two years. Artificial pollination experiments indicated that the two morphs were strongly self-incompatible and crosses between the same morphs (HxH or LxL) produced seeds in higher percentage. These results suggest that the dimorphic nature in P. nipponica does not exhibit an ordinary heterostyly but may be regarded as an example of herkogamous polymorphism. We briefly discuss on the possible adaptive significance of dimorphic natures of the flowers exhibited by P. nipponica.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003733654");

The diploid cytotype seems to be restricted to Okinawa and its neighboring area and also probably to Taiwan, while the hexaploid seems to be widely distributed from Taiwan north to warm temperate regions of Japan. From differences in chromosome number and spore and leaf morphologies, the diploid cytotype is regarded as T. miyagii, a species independent of the hexaploid T. angustifrons. The two related species, T. glanduligera and T. cystopteroides, were compared to the complex.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003733664");

Although the two species have generally been regarded as hermaphroditic, we found that W. pseudoretusa was actually dioecious and W. retusa was hermaphroditic. In plants of W. pseudoretusa, male flowers usually produced functional pollen grains, and their gynoecium was vestigial and lacked ovules, while female flowers had a functional gynoecium, including an ovule, and their anthers were vestigial and completely lacked pollen grains. Based on the morphological properties of these species and on the occurrence of hermaphroditism in a closely related W. retusa, distributed on the continental islands, the Bonin W. pseudoretusa seems to be an example of dioecy evolving from hermaphroditism within the Islands.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318319");

The morphology and anatomy of the leaves of R. indicum f. otakumi and R. indicum f. indicum, its putative ancestor, were examined to determine differences between them. The leaves of f. otakumi are narrower than those of f. indicum, with leaf length to width ratios of 5.10 and 3.38, respectively. Our examination revealed that stenophylly in R. indicum f. otakumi was due to a decrease in the number of cells across the width of the leaf in both the adaxial epidermis and palisade tissues, even though the leaf cells of the epidermis and palisade tissue were larger in R. indicum f. otakumi. The heavy rainfall on Yakushima may have been a factor in the evolution of the narrow leaved form of R. indicum.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318318");

Tetraploids (2n=124) have membranous perispores and long hairs at pinnule margins (0.2-0.4mm long), and grow on forest floors. The occurrence of triploids (2n=93) characterized by abortive spores is also confirmed. Two type specimens belonging to this complex were examined and compared with cytological vouchers. As a result, we regard the diploids as T. musashiensis (stat. nov.), the tetraploids as T. japonica f.japonica (having castaneous stipes) and f.formosa (stat. nov., having stramineous stipes), and the triploids as a hybrid between T.japonica×T. musashiensis.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318324");

A molecular phylogenetic analysis was also conducted using a combined data set of plastid DNA sequences obtained from GenBank to construct a well-resolved phylogenetic tree. The analysis indicated a sister relationship between subtropical-tropical Asian and American disjunct groups (including M. coco and M. mexicana) which was not shown in previous studies. Entire flowers and floral parts (sepals, petals, and gynoecia) of M. coco emitted methyl 2-methylbutanoate (83-96%), whereas entire flowers of M mexicana emitted α-farnesene (67%) which was mainly emitted from the sepals. The petals and gynoecium of M. mexicana emitted methyl 2-methylbutanoate as the main component with relatively small amount of α-farnesene. The common presence of methyl 2-methylbutanoate in the petals and gynoecium of both taxa may represent an ancestral scent profile because subtropical-tropical disjunct groups, which include M. coco in one and M. mexicana in the other, phylogenetically show a sister relationship. The floral scent of M. schiedeana was exclusively composed of monoterpenes, especially geranyl methyl ether (87%). The floral scent of M. dealbata was predominantly composed of benzenoids, especially 2-phenylethanol (78%) and methyl phenylacetate (13%).","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318330");

Macrofossils from the Early Devonian represent low patch-forming land plants that retained bryophyte-characteristics but had branched sporophytes and contained VA-mycorrhiza-like endophytes. Impregnation of cellulosic cell walls by lignin made possible the construction of larger plant bodies exploiting the light/air-space. At the same time the earliest lycophytes appeared, documenting the split of this lineage from the line leading to the remaining green land plants. In the Late Devonian progymnospermous trees appeared in which pseudomonopodial branching was superseded by lateral branching. The acquisition of the seed habit in the seed fern lineage was probably followed by the still problematic transition from the homorhizic pteridophyte organisation to the allorhizic seed plant organisation, the latter also implying axillary branching. During the Carboniferous, in different lineages strange tree constructions evolved, deriving mechanical strength from root mantles, tubular stems, or periderm tissue, yet nearly all of these lineages, at latest by the Permian, succumbed to the shrinking of wetland habitats. The interval from Permian to Mid Cretaceous was mainly a period of variation of the gymnosperm theme, with the rise and demise of several seed fern and other gymnospermous groups. It is most probable that the rise of the angiosperms was mainly due to their flexible developmental system, which permitted, i.e., the evolution of short-lived herbaceous plant bodies and \"cheap\" seeds.

Minimum spanning network of the mtDNA haplotypes showed that haplotypes of primordial origin were geographically quite widespread; whereas those of recent origin were restricted to one or a few localities. Therefore, the phylogenetic information among the mtDNA haplotypes will be useful for the phylogeographic study of Cu. hilgendorfi. Such patterns were not seen in plant cpDNA haplotypes. The host-parasite relationship between Castanopsis and Curculio hilgendorfi also proved to be very tight in this study. If the phylogeographic congruency between phytophagous insects and their host plants could be demonstrated, information about intraspecific mtDNA variation in the phytophagous insect Cu. hilgendorfi would be very useful for the phylogeographic study of Castanopsis type broad-leaved evergreen forests in Japan.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318377");

REPLACE INTO multilingual(`key`,language,value,guid) values("abstract","en","The emergence of terrestrial plant life about 500m ys ago is testified by liverwort-like and later moss-like tissue fragments consisting, i.e., of sporopollenin-containing spore walls and waxy cuticles. Macrofossils from the Early Devonian represent low patch-forming land plants that retained bryophyte-characteristics but had branched sporophytes and contained VA-mycorrhiza-like endophytes. Impregnation of cellulosic cell walls by lignin made possible the construction of larger plant bodies exploiting the light/air-space. At the same time the earliest lycophytes appeared, documenting the split of this lineage from the line leading to the remaining green land plants. In the Late Devonian progymnospermous trees appeared in which pseudomonopodial branching was superseded by lateral branching. The acquisition of the seed habit in the seed fern lineage was probably followed by the still problematic transition from the homorhizic pteridophyte organisation to the allorhizic seed plant organisation, the latter also implying axillary branching. During the Carboniferous, in different lineages strange tree constructions evolved, deriving mechanical strength from root mantles, tubular stems, or periderm tissue, yet nearly all of these lineages, at latest by the Permian, succumbed to the shrinking of wetland habitats. The interval from Permian to Mid Cretaceous was mainly a period of variation of the gymnosperm theme, with the rise and demise of several seed fern and other gymnospermous groups. It is most probable that the rise of the angiosperms was mainly due to their flexible developmental system, which permitted, i.e., the evolution of short-lived herbaceous plant bodies and \"cheap\" seeds. The phenomenon of \"unequal split\", i.e., the difference in number of taxa between sister groups, leads to the notion that evolutionary success is hardly predictable. Instead, evolutionary success seems to depend on the coincidence between the accumulation of interactive traits in a lineage and a benign constellation of environmental opportunities. This is exemplified by the spread of modern filicalean ferns, which diversified during the Cretaceous in the shadow of the angiosperms.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318371");

The highest similarity was detected between U. alpina and U. longifolia among the species studied while the highest pairwise genetic distance was found between U. caerulea and U. longifolia. Principal coordinate analysis was conducted to view the clustering pattern of the taxa which revealed that U. alpina and U. longifolia clustered together whereas U. amethystina, U. bifida, U. caerulea, U. calycifida, U. humboldtii, U. praelonga, U. triflora and U. uliginosa formed another cluster.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318614");

These results suggest that the cpDNA haplotypes of Clade II originated within the Japan and remain as relics in central Honshu and Shikoku. The Japanese origins of two endemic taxa, P. resupinata var. caespitosa Koidz. and var. microphylla Honda are also discussed.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318626");

The latter was previously recognized as either Arabis kawasakiana, Arabis lyrata subsp. kawasakiana or a synonym of Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. kamchatica. We here report the bivalent nature of meiotic chromosome of A. kamchatica subsp. kawasakiana, n=16_<II> and 2n=32. We also provide a molecular evidence of allotetraploidy using a nuclear Chalcone Synthase (CHS) sequence. In conjunction with former chromosomal and morphological studies, we considered that both taxa should be placed under the genus Arabidopsis but distinct from Arabidopsis lyrata. Arabidopsis kamchatica will provide a unique opportunity for the molecular genetic analysis of genome duplication, by utilizing the genetic and genomic information on a model species Arabidopsis thaliana.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318633");

REPLACE INTO multilingual(`key`,language,value,guid) values("abstract","en","ITS and ETS If sequence data were used to estimate the phylogeny of 13 Japanese Schoenoplectus species, and karyomorphological observations were made on 14 species of this genus. Two major clades were identified in the Japanese Schoenoplectus molecular phylogenetic tree: (1) one including all species of section Actaeogeton, and (2) the another comprising the two sections Malacogeton and Schoenoplectus. Phylogenetic analysis, including three published species of section Schoenoplectus, supported a monophyly of the two major clades. These molecular phylogenetic data also support the intrageneric relationships and morphological characters of genus Schoenoplectus, as defined by Smith & Hayasaka (2001). The section Actaeogeton clade and the sections Malacogeton and Schoenoplectus clade showed the same chromosomal evolution; each clade had both high and low chromosome numbers. The high chromosome numbers may arise by polyploidy because chromosome sizes were almost equal in both. Therefore, chromosomal evolution in the genus Schoenoplectus may be caused more by polyploidy more than aneuploidy. In our study, the putative natural hybrids, S. × trapezoideus and S. × uzenensis were found. The chromosome number of S. × trapezoideus was 2n=43 and S. × uzenensis was 2n=58.

To obtain a clear understanding of these cryptic species, the somatic and meiotic chromosomes were examined in 18 sporophytes from different localities and three hybrids synthesized among the three types. The examinations revealed that the north type and the third type are tetraploids with 2n=156 and n=78 chromosomes, whereas the south type is a hypotetraploid with 2n=154 and n=77 chromosomes. Several peculiar configurations were occasionally observed at diakinesis in all three types: single rope-shaped bivalents with acrosyndesis, split bivalents with acrosyndetic connections, and quadrivalent or quadrivalent-like configurations. Occasional quadrivalents indicate the presence of several homologies within the genomes of the three types. Many univalents were observed at metaphase I in the hybrid between the south and north types, whereas only a few univalents were occasionally observed in the hybrids between the third and north types, for which a partial cross-sterility had been reported. This suggests that the chromosomal structure has differentiated little between the genomes of the third type and the north type and that the partial cross-sterility is mostly due to genic differentiation between them.","APG : Acta phytotaxonomica et geobotanica","MASUYAMA SHIGEO;WATANO YASUYUKI","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/lognavi?name=nels&lang=en&type=pdf&id=ART0008323660","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318640","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006318640");

REPLACE INTO multilingual(`key`,language,value,guid) values("abstract","en","A generic classification of Davalliaceae is proposed to recognize five genera and two sections for monophyletic groups detected by molecular phylogenetic studies. The delimitation of the taxa, except for Humata, differs remarkably from the ones adopted in previous classifications. Davallia is divided into sections Davallia and Trogostolon (stat. nov.), of which the former includes Scyphularia and the latter includes Davallia trichomanoides and close relatives. Humata contains Davallia corniculata. The new genus Araiostegiella comprises A. perdurans and two related species, which have long been assigned to Araiostegia. The revived genus Wibelia is composed of W. denticulata (type) and related species. Davallodes is a polymorphic genus that accommodates Paradavallodes, Araiostegia hymenophylloides and its close relatives, as well as Davallodes s.s. A key to the genera and sections and a set of their diagnostic characters are given and new combinations for the species are presented. The exclusion of Gymnogrammitis and Leucostegia from the family is also discussed.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006649692");

In this study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), we determined the genomic structure of A. halleri subsp. gemmifera (Brassicaceae) on Mt. Ibuki, Japan, where two ecotypes adapted to lowland and highland environments grow. Based on 273 loci (4.4% of the loci were outliers), genotypes of 17 and 14 individuals of lowland and highland ecotypes, respectively, were determined. When excluding outliers, genetic differentiation between the two ecotypes was low (F_<ST>=0.017). The genotypes of each ecotype, however, were distinguishable using principle coordinate analysis. The genome-wide investigation of the two ecotypes of A. halleri subsp. gemmifera on Mt. Ibuki therefore suggests that morphological divergence as well as adaptation to local environments between lowland and highland ecotypes occurred recently and the two ecotypes share a similar genomic structure. These two ecotypes are therefore appropriate for studies to reveal the genetic basis of morphological divergence as well as local adaptation using genomic information from A. thaliana.","http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110007681505");

All species are strictly or moderately narrowly distributed, but H. japonicum is widely distributed. The species of Terniopsis differ from each other and from their congeners by the number of stamens, the length of the stamens relative to ovary, and the form of the stigmas.

The family forms the largest, generally epiphytic monophyletic clade with Polypodiaceae including grammitids. Several other lineages include epiphytes. Molecular phylogenies suggest that the davallioid-polypodioid epiphytes diverged from the secondary hemi-epiphytic Oleandraceae in angiosperm-dominated forests in the Paleogene. The evolution of epiphytism in vittarioids and lycophytic Huperzia may be derived directly from terrestrial ancestors. The stepwise evolution of epiphytes is characterized by the ecological shift of gametophytes from the ground to trees following sporophytes, while the abrupt evolution involves the simultaneous shift. Furthermore, reversals from epiphytes to secondary hemi-epiphytes or to terrestrial plants are also likely in other ferns. Precise identification of life forms in the field offers a sound basis of research on epiphyte evolution. There are several morphological traits correlated with life-form change (e.g., rhizome length and dorsiventrality; absorbing or adhering roots; peltate, stalked, dense scales), as well as physiological traits. Epiphytic gametophytes are strap-shaped, ribbon-like or filamentous, branched, gemmiferous and long-lived in, e.g., grammitids, Hymenophyllaceae and vittarioids, while, like terrestrial gametophytes, they are heart-shaped and monocarpic in, e.g., Davalliaceae and Polypodiaceae. Comparative eco-physiological research of gametophytes is needed to investigate the transitions from terrestrial to epiphytic gametophytes. Interactions between epiphytes and hosts should be clarified to understand the evolution of epiphytism.
