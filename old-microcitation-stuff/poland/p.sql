The volume and area of all logs and stumps were measured on four study plots with a total area of 1.432 ha. Spruce regeneration on decaying logs was counted and grouped in age classes. Samples of dead logs were cross dated to examine the decomposition rate in the climatic conditions of the upper montane belt in the Tatra Mts. On average the total volume of logs was 93 m3 ha 1 and constituted 22% of the stem volume of living trees. Logs and stumps covered 4% of the forest floor, occupying a total of 422 m2 ha 1. These values are comparable to those of similar natural spruce forests in the Carpathians and Scandinavia. On each studied plot the portions of wood belonging to each of 8 stages were determined; they seem to indicate a fairly constant supply of dead wood to the forest floor, and to confirm the old growth status of the forest. The oldest cross dated log came from a spruce tree that stopped growing in 1883. This suggests that the time needed for complete decomposition is relatively high, exceeding 100 years. The best substrate for spruce regeneration consisted in the most decomposed logs (stages 7 and 8), with over 1000 spruce saplings per 100 m2 log surface. Fresh logs in decay stages 1 to 3 did not provide good conditions for germination and survival of seedlings. Spruce regeneration appears on mid decomposed logs (stages 4 to 6) about 40 years after tree death.","Polish Botanical Journal","2001","46","2","251","260","ZIELONKA, TOMASZ;PIĄTEK, GRZEGORZ","1641-8190","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-749","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs/data/article_pdf?id=749","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-749");

Its life history traits are discussed on the basis of a case study in the Solling Mts (northwest Germany), with special regard to germination, establishment and growth. Investigations covered an old growth spruce stand and a birch rowan pioneer forest, the latter having developed spontaneously after storm damage in 1982. To emphasize the specific character of S. aucuparia among short lived tree species it is compared with Betula pendula Roth, a short lived tree species also very common in Europe, which is well studied biologically and ecologically. In its early life history, rowan should be considered a very shade tolerant tree species, able to germinate in old growth spruce forests under poor light and on thick layers of raw humus. There is no evidence that germination of rowan is slowed down or impeded by dense cover of Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. For birch the most suitable site conditions for germination and establishment are provided by moist sites with high relative light intensities and naturally or anthropogenously loosened topsoil layers. Once established, rowan is able to build up a ramet bank through a `guerrilla&apos; type of clonal growth in the organic layer and can thus successfully penetrate into closed vegetation cover. Whereas rowan acts as a `stress tolerant competitor&apos; in its early life history, birch tends to have a more ruderal strategy by very successfully colonizing severely disturbed habitats and growing rapidly.","Polish Botanical Journal","2001","46","2","229","239","ZERBE, STEFAN","1641-8190","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-747","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs/data/article_pdf?id=747","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-747");

Fungal1 biodiversity was particularly high in evergreen oak forests of the Grosseto coast. Classification of samples brought out affinities and differences between the various fungal communities. Ordering by detrended correspondence analysis revealed that the relevés were disposed along a climate altitude gradient. The health status of the forests, evaluated according to criteria proposed by Central European authors, was generally found to be good. The period of major fungal fruiting was autumn, though the duration of fruiting varied between different environments: in high altitude and coastal environments, the fungal mycelium produced carpophores nearly all year round, whereas no carpophores were found for many months in the hill belt.","Polish Botanical Journal","2002","47","2","143","165","LAGANÀ, ANGELA;SALERNI, ELENA;BARLUZZI, CARLA;DOMINICIS, VINCENZO;PERINI, CLAUDIA","1641-8190","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-769","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs/data/article_pdf?id=769","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-769");

Due to the slow development and extremely slow rate of decay of the kelo trees, also the fungi living on them seem to be slow in their colonization, needing a continuity in the supply of the substrate.

We recorded the size of 25 selected Sphagnum cushions, the proportion of Sphagnum species making up the cushions, and the vascular plant species found in the cushions. The Sphagnum carpets broke up into smaller cushions, and below a critical size (~660 cm2) the risk of their disappearance was high. The two Sphagnum species disappeared at approximately similar rates, but cushions consisting of both species were more likely to survive than single species cushions. As their environment became wetter in 1997, the cushions increased in size, but the two Sphagnum species were not able to survive the sudden rise of the water level in 1998. For protection of Hungarian Sphagnum dominated mires the aim is to minimize fluctuation of the water level, which can be achieved by reconstructing the buffer zone.","Polish Botanical Journal","2003","48","2","163","169","NAGY, JÁNOS;NÉMETH, NÓRA;FIGECZKY, GÁBOR","1641-8190","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-800","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs/data/article_pdf?id=800","http://bomax.botany.pl/pubs-new/#article-800");
