The results showed that the diameter at breast height (DBH) in site L were remarkably smaller than that in site G, when plants started flowering and fruit setting. The number of flower buds, total number of inflorescences and ratio of male inflorescences were not significantly correlated with DBH and plant height (P>0.05). The number of male inflorescences increased with increment of total number of inflorescences by logarithm curve, and the trees trended to develop male inflorescences under lower reproductive investment, while mainly develop female inflorescences under larger reproductive investment. There were remarkable differences in characteristics of reproductive module between both sites, the number of male buds and number of inflorescences developed from each male bud at site L was significantly lower than that in site G (P<0.05), the ratio of the plants with male inflorescences less than female ones was much higher than that at site G, and the ratio of reproductive branches was also significantly lower than that at site G (P<0.05). Although the number of male inflorescences, female inflorescences, total inflorescences and ratio of male inflorescences at site L were smaller than those at site G, and ratio of female inflorescences at site L was larger than that at site G, there were no significant difference between them (P>0.05) due to high level of variation among individuals at each site.

By comparing Models M1a/M2a and M7/M8 under random-site models, six amino acid sites (149I, 251M, 255V, 282F, 359S and 375F) were found to be positively selected. The site 282F plays an important role in maintaining Rubisco function. Under branch-site models, no adaptive site was identified in the epiphytic clade, whereas two sites(230A and 247C) were detected in the ceratopteridoid clade. In comparison with shade conditions, aquatic habitats may have imposed stronger selection on the pteridaceous RbcL subunits. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree reconstructed with uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock model shows that the pteridaceous fern radiations occurred during the Oligocene, suggesting possible roles played by the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. These results provide new insights into how leptosporangiate ferns response to the terrestrial ecosystem changes caused by the rise of angiosperms.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.01.001");

To ensure their reproductive success, L. chinense seems to pursue the strategy of augment to the number of reproductive organ, while L. tulipifera takes the way of improvement for the reproductive efficiency.

There’s significant difference among the proportions of perfect, worm-eaten, abortive, decayed and germinated seeds in the process of seed rain, in which the proportion of the worm-eaten was 19.44 times as great as the geminated. In the soil seed bank, the proportion of the worm-eaten seed was 53.79%. Compared with the seed rain, the quantities of the perfect and geminated seed were less 2.15 seeds m-2 and 0.20 seeds m-2 respectively. Seed survival rate and the proportion of seed damaged by animals were 13.51% and 45.90%, respectively, which showed that animal damage was the main cause of seed loss. In total, 69 species of seeds were recorded in the soil seed bank, with a very low density of germinable seeds and most of them were buried in 2~5 cm in soil. Seedling density of C. chungii was very low in the nature forest, which was closely related to the seed characteristics and habitat. Due to the animal invasion, rotten, abortion, and so on, it’s difficult for C. chungii mature seed to long-term preserve in the soil, and the natural regeneration of C. chungii forest was blocked seriously.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.01.013");
