Except of Acer davidii, there was not significant difference in maximum photosynthetic rate at saturating light (Pmax) between the deciduous and evergreen species, but maximum stomatal conductance at saturating light (Gmax) was higher in the deciduous species than the evergreen species in rainy season. However, in dry season, the decreases of Pmax and Gmax were greater in the deciduous species than the evergreen species, as accompanied by the larger increases in dark respiration rate and light compensation point in the former. The deciduous and evergreen species had slight difference in apparent quantum yield (AQY) and predawn maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm-predawn) in rainy season. However, in dry season, the deciduous species showed lower AQY and Fv/Fm-predawn than the evergreen species, suggesting that the deciduous species suffered greater photoinhibition. Furthermore, there was a significant linear relationship between P and G, and the evergreen species showed lower slope, indicating that the evergreen species had higher photosynthetic water use efficiency and this would help them to survive in dry and cold conditions. Also, the significant linear correlations of P with electron transport rate and leaf temperature were observed in both the deciduous and evergreen species, and the evergreen species exhibited lower slope; this indicates that the evergreen species could adjust the electron transport rate through alternative electron pathways to adapt to the wide range of seasonal temperatures. In conclusion, the results obtained here suggest that the deciduous species required relatively higher temperature and water supply than the evergreen  species to meet the needs of photosynthesis; under dry and cold situations, it’s therefore unavoidable for them to suffer greater photoinhibition and shed their leaves finally, although the coordinated adjustments in stomata and photosystem II occurred in them. By contrast, the evergreen species could adapt to dry and cold stresses and maintain green leaves by promoting photosynthetic water use efficiency through stomatal control and dissipating excessive light energy via electron allocation.

A climacteric peak of respiration rate appeared at the 7th day of vase life. ATP treatment enhanced the respiration rate. Furthermore, a linear relationship existed between cytochrome respiration and total respiration. The contribution from the cytochrome respiration pathway to the total respiration increased after 4 days of vase holding, which indicated that the electron transport depended mainly on the cytochrome respiration pathway. Treatment with ATP increased the capacity, operative activity and operation coefficient of the alternative respiration pathway, and the ratio of the alternative respiration pathway to the total respiration increased after 4 days of vase holding with a significant linear relationship between the alternative respiration pathway capacity and the total respiration.

Eight organic acids (malic, quinic, citric, iso-citric, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric, oxaloacetic and tartaric acids) were identified in ripe pulp, while trace quantities of ferulic, cis-aconitic and β-coumaric acids were identified in several cultivars. The predominant organic acid of ripe pulp of most cultivars was malic acid, with an average content of 4 399 mg kg-1 FW for all cultivars, accounting for 62.7% to the total acids. Quinic acid was the second in abundance, with an average content of 2 042 mg kg-1 FW, accounting for 29.1% to the total acids. Other acids ranged from trace to 3.0% of the total acids.

There were two sets of plots at both sites respectively: ones were covered with litters on the surface soil and the others without litters. The annual average CH4 fluxes from plot with litters were -3.41±0.3 kg CH4 hm-2a-1 in the pine plantation and -3.24±0.44 kg CH4 hm-2a-1 in the orchard; annual average N2O fluxes were 4.57±0.50 kg N2O-N hm-2a-1 and 11.99±0.67 kg N2O-N hm-2a-1, respectively. The annual average CH4 fluxes from plot without litters were -2.98±0.44 kg CH4 hm-2a-1 in the pine plantation and -1.93±0.53 kg CH4 hm-2a-1 in the orchard; annual average N2O fluxes were 3.12±0.28 kg N2O-N hm-2a-1 and 9.42±0.56 kg N2O-N hm-2a-1, respectively. N2O fluxes from soil surface were closely related to the types of land use. They were significantly higher from orchard than those from pine plantation (P<0.01). CH4 absorptions were higher in dry season (October~March) and lower in rainy season (April~September). N2O fluxes were higher in rainy season and lower in dry season. The results indicated that CH4 and N2O fluxes from soil surface were affected by soil water content more than temperature. CH4 absorptions were affected little by litter removal. The litter decomposition accounted for 31.71％ and 21.40％ of the total N2O emissions from the pine plantation and from orchard soil surface, respectively.

The concentration of glycerin was regarded as an essential factor for SOD stability, the optimum glycerin concentration was 12.5%～25%. It was demonstrated that 10℃, pH 6.8 and 1 000 r min-1 of mix round was the optimum condition to improve the SOD stability under hot stress, the half life of glycerin entrapment SOD in hot stress at 50 ℃ was 25.1 d, which was 5 times of the natural SOD not glycerin entrapment. Entrapment at pH 3.8 was more effective to improve the endurance of SOD in acidic stress，whereas, pH 8.9 was more resultful to enhance the stability in alkaline stress. Adding of Zn2+、Cu2+、Fe2+ was favor to enhance the stability of glycerin entrapment SOD under hot stress. Glycerin entrapment SOD also showed a rather strong tolerance in some additives of cosmetics.

With respect to the life form of alien invasive plants distributed in Guangzhou, the most dominant plant are terrestrial herbs (58 species), then shrubs (10 species),  aquatic herbs (3 species) and trees (2 species), which distributed in the area of heavily disturbed and low altitude. In addition, based on the growing, dispersal status and other ecological features of the invasive plants in the field, eleven alien invasive species were evaluated to be at the highest degree of threat to the local biodiversity, twenty five at the medium, and 37 at the lowest. Constitutional analysis of the original locality of the alien invasive species revealed that 61 species were from tropical America and took up 83.6% of the total species in Guangzhou. Comparing with other domestic regions in terms of the number of the alien invasive plants, Guangzhou and Guangxi share the most and have 62 species. However, concerning the species that have caused serious threat to local biodiversity, Guangzhou shared eight species with Hong Kong, seven species with Shenzhen, and six species with Guangxi. Moreover, we also evaluated the potential threat for those alien plants that grow in Guangzhou and have caused serious biodiversity damages in other domestic regions. Our result reveals that the government should pay much attention to monitoring these invasive species so as to prevent them from dispersing and causing ecology disaster in Guangzhou.

As a result, 176 species belonging to 82 genera in 37 families are now recorded for Guangzhou. Three species, Dicranopteris gigantea, Hymenophyllum spinosum, and Dryopteris gymnosora, are newly recorded from Guangdong. The five species-rich families are Thelypteridaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Polypodiaceae, Athyriaceae and Pteridaceae. The geographical distribution of the species shows that this flora mainly consists of tropical & subtropical Asian and eastern Asian elements but lacks local endemics. About 80% of the species of this flora grow in humid habitats of dense forest, about 20% occur in relatively dry habitats such as sparse forest and shrub in roadsides, and two species are hydrophytic. Regarding the horizontal distribution in Guangzhou, only a very small proportion of the species occurs in the southern and central areas, but about 90% grow in the montane area of Conghua in northeastern Guangzhou, from which 74 species only occur in Conghua. Within Guangzhou, the abundance of the 176 species can be classified in four groups, i.e., 33 species are Cop (copiosae)2, 48 are Cop1, 53 are Sp (sparsal) and 41 are Sol (solitariae). Fifteen species, i.e., Phlegmariurus austrosinicus, Angiopteris fokiensis, Hymenophyllum spinosum, Alsophila denticulata, A. metteniana, A. podophylla, A. spinulosa, Ceratopteris thalictroides, Diplazium tomitaroanum, Dictyocline mingchegensis, Metathelypteris adscendens, Leptogramma scallanii, Brainea insignis, Woodwardia prolifera and Arachniodes nigrospinosa, are evaluated as rare and endangered in Guangzhou but not under any effective protection at present.

However, exceptions to this ‘one to one rule’ are discovered. The patterns of co-divergence and speciation are expected in fig-fig wasp relations owing to extreme host specificity.

The changes in peel colour, contents of starch and soluble and activities of cell wall degradation-related enzymes, such as polygalaturonase (PG), pectinmethylesterase (PME) and cellulase, were measured. The results showed that banana fruits degreened and softened normally during ripening at 20℃, while ripening at 30℃, the fruits hastened the softening and inhibited the degreening of the peel, resulting in the development of a pale greenish yellow colour. Furthermore, compared with the fruits ripened at 20℃, the starch in fruits ripened at 30℃ enhanced the conversion to soluble sugar, and the activities of PG, PME and cellulase were increased. It was suggested that there were relationship between green-ripe banana fruit at high temperature and soluble sugar in peel, but irrelevant to softening-related physiological changes.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2008.06.007");

The basic conditions for the division of labor in clonal plants includes: environmental heterogeneity, specialization, cooperation, and the potential independence of ramets. According to these conditions, division of labor in clonal plants could be classified into two types, i.e., environmentally induced and developmentally programmed division of labor. Clonal plants can efficiently utilize the heterogeneous resources by means of physiological integration and morphological or physiological plasticity. Division of labor in clonal plants could raise the acquisition efficiency of the local resources, overcome the local resource limitation and enhance the biomass and fitness. These effects could be explained by the theory of marginal cost and scale reward in economics. Division of labor in clonal plants can also enhance the competitive capacity of inter-specific competition, reinforce the efficiency of foraging behavior, and weaken the effects of self-thinning. The risks of division of labor in unstable habitats also exist. The application of the methods of modern biology, the studies on the division of labor in clonal plants will be promoted.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2008.06.017");

The species association in I. lanceolatum community was studied based on 2×2 contingency tables of species, including analysis of species association and χ2 test. The results showed that the significant positive associations [W(49.607)＞χ20.05,32(46.194)] were present among the tree species as a whole in the community. The percentage of species-pairs with significant positive association among them was higher than that with significant negative association, and the number of species-pair without significant association had the highest percentage, which implied that the community was stable. There were significant positive associations between I. lanceolatum and species, such as Photinia serrulata, Eurya acutisepala, Castanopsis sclerophylla and Symplocos setchuensis etc., and the significant negative association only occured with Liquidambar formosana, but it had no correlationship with most species. The association coefficients (AC) between I. lanceolatum and most species are more than 0.5 (about 74.3%), with positive species-pairs more than negative, which implied a dominant status of I. lanceolatum in the community and a coexisting relation with other species.

Propagation methods of direct sowing and sapling transplanting in the spring were applied, and three types of planting sites were experimented with M. oleifera for three years, i.e., irrigated farmland, farmland without irrigation and the waste sloping land in the mountainous area.. The following results were concluded from the three year introduction experiment. (1) The M. oleifera plants grown on the farmland by the both two propagation methods could normally bloom and bear fruits in the first year. The plants grown on the waste sloping land could not bear fruits or bear little in the first year, and the young shoots of some plants severely dried out because of the drought. While the trees planted on the former farmland could bear some fruits, but the yield was lower than that on the farmland. (2) The development rhythm of M. oleifera bearing basal shoot and fruit spurs was different from most of tree species. The fruit spurs of different ages could simultaneously develop on the same fruit bearing basal shoots, and the same fruit bearing basal shoot could produce fruit spurs continuously for many times. (3) The peak period of fruit elongating growth was earlier than that of girth growth. (4) Fruits consumed as fresh vegetable should be harvested before fibrosis, which took place from the elongating growth of the fruits ended to the girth growth stage started. (5) It was demonstrated by the preliminary results of the experiment that M. oleifera was a moderate drought resistant species, and it might fit to be planted in arid or semiarid areas in tropical or sub-tropical climate zones in China. It was recommended that great attention should be paid to planting site selection before the cultivation area is extended.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2008.06.016");

But as for the taxa distributed in Yunnan, especially those reached the national boundary, their endemism to China is questionable and need to be carefully recognized according to updated distribution data. The change of distribution for Craspedolobium schochii is a good example. It was recognized as one genus endemic to China previously. However, according to recent investigations, the distribution of this species is extended southwards to the centers of Laos and Thailand. Some genera in such cases were temporarily recognized as endemic to China because of no distribution data available from neighboring countries. The endemism of such Chinese plants is not unchangeable when new distribution data are available. Therefore, it is of great necessity to strengthen the cooperation with the neighboring countries for further investigations on the vegetation and flora in these regions.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2008.03.013");
