In the present taxonomic literature, the classification and identification of species in the genus is mainly based on the characters of culm leaves and young culm. However, the sprouting period of most species, is between spring and summer for only 20-30 d, and it is rather difficult to observe fresh bamboo shoots or fresh culm-sheaths and young culms in the other seasons, so that both the present key to the species and the description of characters are poor for the identification of plants in non-sprouting state. To solve this problem, the more taxonomic evidence is needed to be looked for. On the basis of a long-term field investigation with a continued observation under cultivation in several Chinese bamboo gardens, some vegetative characters in non-sprouting state, such as length of culm-intranode, arrangement of branchlet and leaf, status of leaf-auricle and oral seta, status of leaf-ligule, and hair on the abaxial surface of leaf, etc. were discovered to play important roles in classification of the species rank. If the characters were used properly and combination with the others, all of species known in the genus in non-sprouting state could be efficiently distinguished. A key to species, according mainly to vegetative characters in non-sprouting state, is prepared here for field works.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.01.002");

In order to understand the status of invasive alien plants in the region, the number of species, distribution and spread in Nanjishan Nature Reserve were surveyed from 2010 to 2014. The results showed that there were 32 exotic invasive species, belonging to 28 genera and 18 families in the area. Compositae and Amaranthaceae are the dominant families with 8 and 4 species, respectively. The exotic plants are mainly originated from South America and Centre America (34.88%), North America (20.93%) and Europe (20.93%). Based on occurrence frequency, invasion area and dispersal status, five species, such as Avena fatua, Conyza canadensis, Daucus carota, Soliva anthemifolia, Alternanthera philoxeroides, have caused serious harm. The number and the kinds of alien invasive plants that cause severe threat to local biodiversity in Nanjishan Nature Reserve had similar with those in adjacent areas.

Based on the evidence of chloroplast rbcL sequences, it was confirmed that A. squamosa is a member of the Hemionitids, one of four well-supported clades resolved by molecular data. The American Notholaena, within which the farinose gametophytes were formerly reported, was resolved as monophyletic, forming a sister group to the Hemionitids. As the farinose gametophyte now observed in two of the four clades of cheilanthoid ferns (Heminitids and Notholaenids), it was postulated that the farinose gametophyte would be derived independently at least twice in the evolution of the cheilanthoid ferns.

EgrAGO genes could be divided into 3 clades, and intron and exon structures had obvious tissue specificity. The nucleotide sequence of EgrAGO and encoding amino acid sequence in each clade had homologies for 88.14% and 82.97%, respectively. Meanwhile, EgrAGO genes distribute in 2, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11 chromosomes with tandem duplication and segmental duplication in the process of evolution. Most of EgrAGO proteins localize in nucleus and cytoplasm, showing basicity, hydrophilia and high aliphatic index. Furthermore, the expression of EgrAGOs in different tissues had significant differences, and which was high in tissues or organs related with wood forming.

Subcellular localization indicated that MaWRKY11 was exclusively localized in the nucleus, implying that it was a nuclear protein. Transactivation assay showed that MaWRKY11 possessed transcriptional activity in yeast cells and the transcriptional domain located at its N-terminus. Moreover, real-time quantitative PCR displayed that MaWRKY11 was induced by chilling stress, and MeJA treatment which could alleviate chilling injury of banana fruit, up-regulated the expression of MaWRKY11. In addition, C-terminus of MaWRKY11 was used as a bait to screen its potential interacting proteins by using yeast two-hybrid system, and it was found that MaWRKY11 could interact with Early Responsive to Dehydration Protein, MaERD, which was also induced by cold. Taken together, these results suggest that MaWRKY11 might respond to chilling stress through interacting with stress-related proteins, such as MaERD.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.05.009");

The results showed that both KCl and K2SO4 fertilizer could increase the activities of POD and CAT, and the contents of IAA and GA3, but decreased MDA content, and thus increased the yield of flowering Chinese cabbage. With the increasing of potassium levels from 0 to 6 kg.( 666.7m2 )-1, the contents of IAA and GA3, the activities of POD and CAT and flower stalk yield increased significantly, however, when the potassium levels increased for further, the contents of IAA and GA3 decreased quickly, and POD activities and flower stalk yield kept stable. At the same potassium levels, two types of potassium fertilizer had no effect on plant growth, flower stalk yield and GA3 contents of leaves. At 0～6 kg.(666.7m2)-1 of potassium fertilizer, the POD activities in leaves fertilized by KCl were higher than those fertilized by K2SO4, but at levels of 9～12 6kg.(666.7m2)-1, K2SO4 fertilizer exerted higher promotion on POD activity. CAT activities in leaves fertilized by 6kg.(666.7m2)-1 of KCl and MDA contents in leaves fertilized by 3 kg.(666.7m2)-1 of KCl were lower than those fertilized by same levels of K2SO4. In contrary, treatment with 6kg.(666.7m2)-1 and 12kg.(666.7m2)-1 of KCl exerted higher promotion on IAA contents than K2SO4 fertilizer. At other fertilizer levels, two types of potassium fertilizer had no effects on CAT activity, MDA and IAA contents. In concluded, although two potassium types exerted different influence on the reactive oxygen species metabolic system and endogenous hormones in plants, they had no effects on the plant growth and flower stalk yield of flowering Chinese cabbage at the same levels of potassium fertilizer. Thus, in the field production, KCl fertilizer can be used to save the cost instead of K2SO4 fertilizer, and the effect of 6 kg.(666.7m2)-1 of KCl fertilizer showed the best.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.05.010");

Based on their physiological functions, all identified proteins could be involved in stress response and defense (accounting for 56%), energy and carbon metabolism (19%), primary metabolites pathway (5%), protein transport (5%), cytoskeleton (5%) and some other metabolic processes. Among them, most proteins related to antioxidant system were down-regulated. It was implied that the ability of antioxidant of longan aril was decreased in postharvest, which could not effectively alleviate the toxicity caused by ROS accumulation. In addition, the enzymes associated with energy metabolism were also downregulated, suggesting that the deterioration of postharvest longan aril might be related to the insufficient of energy supply. So, these results will provide a scientific basis for studying preservation technology of postharvest longan.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.04.005");

By using the method of combining water-injection induced hydraulic pressure and sap flow changing device together with whole-plant container weighing in verifying the Granier empirical formula and calibrating the coefficient. In addition, we observed structure of vascular bundle in 5 bamboo species (Phyllostachys edulis、Bambusa chungii、Bambusa textilis、Arundinaria amabilis、Bambusa vulgaris). Vascular bundles were randomly scatted across the culms in uneven. Development degree of vascular bundles was different which vascular bundles close to the inside of clum were better than outside. Vascular bundles close to the inside of culm had better transporting water capability than outside. In the cut bamboo experiments, we found that Fd and K followed a power function and all the  R2＞0.83. This suggested TDP method was an applicable technique for assessing sap flow density in bamboo species. Furthermore, whole-plant container weighing method corrected the equation coefficients and gained the new sap flow formula for every bamboo kind. The new sap flow formula was different from the Grnaier empirical formula which a was several times more than original a. The daily transpiration calculated by new equation and Granier empirical formula had a significant difference, especially during the peak hours (at noon) of  sap flow in one day . Our study concluded that as long as the TDP method is carefully verificated and Granier empirical formula is corrected, then TDP method is an applicable technique for assessing water use in bamboo species.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.05.012");

And the shape of long cell, pattern of anticlinal wall, shape of stomatal subsidiary cells, and number of prickle hairs could be used to identify species. The correlation analysis showed that there were significant negative correlations between stomatal density and stomatal length, stomatal width. Besides, the thickness of bulliform cells had significant positive correlations with thickness of cuticular layer and adaxial epidermis for 5 species. According to leaf epidermal traits in Gramineae, the evolution trend was in the order of S. viridis → S. glauca and S. faberii → S. plicata and S. chondrachne.

Results showed that the net reproductive biomass allocation and seed biomass allocation of S. italica planted with neighboring kins increased and the vegetative biomass allocation decreased significantly than those planted with neighboring non-kins. Under high plant density, the ear length, net reproductive biomass allocation and seed biomass allocation of kin group of S. italica were significantly higher than those of non-kin group (P<0.05), while the vegetative biomass allocation was lower. As soil nutrient level increased, the proportion of biomass allocation to seed of S. italica planted with neighboring kins significantly increased, while that of vegetative biomass allocation significantly decreased (P<0.05). It suggested that S. italica can recognize its kin neighbors, and this ability was regulated by plant density and soil nutrient level.

Both of genes had typical conserved domain of AP2/ERF, named as PbERF2 and PbERF4, with GenBank accession No. of KJ623716 and KJ623718, respectively. The phylogenetic tree showed that PbERF2 had closed correlation with ERF1 in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) and PbERF4 was closed to ERF1 in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that expressions of PbERF2 and PbERF4 in pericarps were higher than those in sarcocarps, and both hardly expressed in leaves. Real-time RT-PCR showed that expressions of PbERF2 and PbERF4 in pericarps of ‘Xiusu’ was significant higher than those in ‘Dangshansuli’, and expression trend of them was upgrade at first and then descend.

The morphological characteristics and ultrastructure of colony were observed under light microscope and electron transmission microscope. The molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). The results showed that two new records of Pseudo-nitzschia from China were identified, i.e., P. galaxiae Lundholm & Moestrup and P. micropora Priisholm, Moestrup & Lundholm. Their detailed morphological characteristics have been described and compared with similar species. All strains of these two new records had no domoic acid (DA) production by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These would provide basic data for studying species diversity and domoic acid production of genus Pseudo-nitzschia in the China sea.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.00.000");

The results showed that soil microbial community composition in C. carlesii forest was rich, the diversity index, richness index and evenness index of soil microbial communities for the two forests were 2.92-3.01, 25.84-28.23 and 0.88-0.90, respectively. The total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, actinomycete PLFAs, gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and gram-negative bacterial PLFAs at soil depth of 0-10 cm were higher than those of 10-20 cm, and those in Jian'ou were higher than those in Wuyi Mountain. The ratio of gram-positive bacterial PLFAs to gram-negative bacterial PLFAs at soil depth of 10-20 cm was higher than that of 0-10 cm. In each soil layer, the content of bacterial PLFAs was significantly higher than those of fungal PLFAs, accounting for 46.0%-50.2% and 10.0%-11.5%, respectively, indicating that bacteria were dominated in soil microbial community. Principal component analysis showed that the difference in soil microbial community structure came from the sampling site.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.06.009");

The results showed that the cp genome of P. polyphylla var. chinensis was 158307 bp in length and display a typical quadripartite structure including two inverted repeat regions (IRA and IRB, 27473 bp), one small singlecopy region (SSC, 18175 bp) and one large single-copy region (LSC, 85187 bp). It contained 115 unique genes, including 81 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs. The genome structure, gene contents and arrangement of 10 Liliales species cp genomes were very similar. The cemA gene of P. polyphylla var. chinensis was pseudogene with poly(A) and CA SSR patterns after the start codon, and the loci of premature stop codons are different from those of Paris veticillata. In conclusion, the cp genome of P. polyphylla var. chinensis was conservative. The cemA structure and pseudogenization might play an important role in the evolution and phylogeny, and the location of the stop codons in cemA was useful for distinguishing P. polyphylla var. chinensis from P. veticillata.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2015.06.001");
