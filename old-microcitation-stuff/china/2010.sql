The variation coefficient of biomass ratio was higher in flower than in other organs, which showed that this weed had high ability to adjusting reproduction allocation. Plant height had significant positive correlation with each module biomass and increased in the power function with the latter increment. Biomass allocation of flower had significant positive correlation with total biomass, but did not that of other organs. The biomass allocation was transferred from nutrition module, supporting module and photosynthesis module to reproduction module. In summary, A. subulatus had better assignment strategy for resource and stronger adaptive ability to heterogeneous environment.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.02.011");

The structures of phytoplankton community at five sites varied markedly and seasonally from spring to winter, and the dynamic pattern of phytoplankton community was quite similar among the five sampling sites. The phytoplankton biomass in flood season was higher than that in dry season. The phytoplankton benefited from high temperature in flood season and nutrient input with inflow. Phytoplankton biomass showed a spatial gradient from riverine zone to lacustrine zone, corresponding to a decrease in phosphorus concentration.

The results showed that root and shoot growth pattern were similar among C. flabelliformis, V. zizanioides, and H. littoralis, with a fast growth stage before September or October, and a slow growth stage during the following months, while P. australis was very different, with slow growth of root and shoot before July, and rapid growth maintained throughout winter. H. littoralis exhibited significantly faster root growth and significantly larger root biomass than other species (P<0.01), while V. zizanioides showed significantly slower root growth and a significantly smaller root biomass than other species (P<0.01). Roots of V. zizanioides generally grew vertically, while the roots of the other species were predominantly distributed in the shallow layer of the substrate. C. flabelliformis produced the most tillers, and had the highest leaf area index (LAI), while V. zizanioides showed the smallest LAI. The results suggest that P. australis could be planted with other wetland species to achieve high decontamination rates in treatment wetlands during the autumn and winter months.

Four plantations representing a chronic series of restoration, including barren land, Eucalyptus forest, mixed broad-leaved plantation and secondary natural forest, were compared. Soil bulk density, water holding capacity and soil porosity were determined. The results showed that barren land with little vegetation cover had  high soil bulk density (>1.5 g cm-3), and Eucalyptus plantation established on barren land made soil hardened and the water holding capacity became worse partly because of litter removal by villagers. Replacement of Eucalyptus plantation with mixed broad-leaved plantation markedly increased the water holding capacity of soil. Soil bulk density (0~40 cm) of the mixed broad-leavedf plantation was below 1.3 g cm-3 , and the total porosity was 46.1%～51.4%,and their non-capillary porosity were 15.0%～22.7%. The maximum water storage of the soil (0～40 cm) was 1892 t hm-2, a level similar to those of many other broad-leaved forests. The secondary natural forest located nearby had a better water-holding capacity than the mixed broad-leaved plantation. The surface soil bulk density was only 1.07 g cm-3, and the total porosity was 58%, and the maximum water-holding capacity was 538 g kg-1. Compared to those in 1983, mixed broad-leaved plantations largely improved soil physical properties with lowered soil bulk density and enhanced water-holding capacity. However, soils of barren land and Eucalyptus plantation had changed little, with hard surface soil and low water holding capacity. The results indicated that establishment of highly diversified plantation could enhance water infiltration and water holding capacity of soil.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.04.001");

Forteen genera were identified, and most of them were filamentous and colonial ones, such as Pseudanabaena, Limnothrix, Dactylococcopsis, Cylindrospermopsis and Chroococcus. Cyanobacteria abundance in two reservoirs ranged from 119 to 137373 cells mL-1, and microcystin concentration from 0 to 2.26 μg L-1. In Fenghuangshan Reservoir with relatively long retention time (160 d), microcystin concentration was lower than the national standard for drinking water of 1 μg L-1 throughout the year, which the maximum was in March. In the short retention time (60 d) reservoir, Nanping Reservoir, the concentration of microcystin was higher than that in Fenghuangshan reservoir in the flood season with the maximum in July. In Fenghuangshan Reservoir, the abundance of cyanobacteria was one order higher than that in Nanping reservoir. Maximal abundance occurred in dry season (March) in both the reservoirs, and nutrient loading related to pumping strategy and temperature were two possible factors in seasonal variation of cyanobacteria abundance. In Fenghuangshan Reservoir, Pseudanabaena, Limnothrix and Cylindrospermopsis were dominant in cyanobacteria and contributed more than 50% of the total abundance at most of time. In Nanping Reservoir, cyanobacteria was dominated by filamentous species in dry season and by colonial species in flood season. The temperature and nutrient loading related to pumping strategy seemed to key factors inducing cyanobacteria seasonally dominated by different ecotypes of species in Nanping Reservoir.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.03.002");

Cunn. ex Benth. was investigated in a seed orchard at Shadui Town, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province with the flower morphology observed under light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A. auriculiformis flowered from August to December. Its spike inflorescence consisted of 114.9±11.9 flowers, bearing 124.1±16.5 anthers in each flower. Within each anther existed eight pollen sacs, and eight polyads were produced with 16 pollen grains in each. It thus accounted of 15885 grains per flower. The pistil contained an average of 14.4±1.8 ovules with a smooth, wet stigma and a solid style. Pollen to ovule ratio (P/O) was 1103.1. Anthesis normally began at night and the whole process of flowering could be divided into 5 stages. The phenomena that style emerged from flower bud before stamen and that stamen emerged firstly were all observed during anthesis at different trees, which was inferred that A. auriculiformis was homogamous. As observed under SEM, anther began to dehisce along dehiscent line at stage 2, and completely opened at stage 4. Abundant polyads were released between 9:00 and 12:00. The stigma exudate emerged apparently during the first half-day after anthesis and then decreased gradually. Stigmas started to wilt at 3~4 days after anthesis. The stigma receptivity lasted about 3 days and the peak of receptivity began after 10: 00 at the first day.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.04.006");

Based on the precipitation allocation principles, the variation and input characteristics of these nutrients were calculated. The results showed that the contents of nutrient elements were in order as rainfall < throughfall < stemfall, in which the contents of K+ and total nitrogen (TN) were the highest, and those of total phosphorus (TP), HPO42- and total organic phosphorus (TOP) were the lowest. The biggest variation coefficient (Cv) of ion contents in precipitation was 1.282 for total organic nitrogen (TON), and the smallest was 0.502 for NO3-, while those in throughfall were 2.357 for TOP and 0.621 for TN, respectively. There were no significant relation between tree species and the contents of element (P>0.05). The annual inputs of nutrient elements from throughfall and stemflow into the soil were in the order as: TN>K+> Ca2+>Mg2+>TP. The annual input of Ca2+ from throughfall and stemflow were higher than that from litterfall decomposition. It concluded that rainfall was an important factor in transferring nutrient elements from forest canopy to soils.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.05.006");

The N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured in situ using the static chamber technique and analyzed with gas chromatogram for 15 days. The results showed that E. lepta did not significantly enhance soil N2O and CH4 fluxes, but fake plant (to simulate the physical effects of E. lepta) significantly increased soil N2O emissions (P<0.05). Earthworm promoted soil N2O fluxes in both control (without plant or fake plant) and the treatment with E. lepta by 26.7% and 66.3%, respectively. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effects of additional earthworm on soil N2O fluxes were not always positive. In the treatment with fake plant, the earthworm effects decreased the N2O fluxes by 39.7%. Meanwhile, the earthworm increased the CH4 uptake by 10.3% in control, but decreased the CH4 uptake by 90.6% in the treatment with fake plant and decreased CH4 uptake by 301.8% in the treatment with E. lepta. Earthworm addition shifted the soil CH4 from uptake to emission in the treatment with E. lepta and significantly decreased soil CH4 uptake in the treatment with fake plant (P<0.05). The results indicated that earthworm could accelerate soil N2O emission and might even convert CH4 sinks into sources in the A. auriculaeformis plantation. The physical effect of E. lepta facilitated soil N2O emission, while the biological processes of E. lepta might suppress soil N2O efflux. No significant correlations between N2O as well as CH4 fluxes and hydrothermal factors were found in the present study. In order to reduce the soil greenhouse gas emission, it will be useful to consider both the independent and interactive effects of plant physical processes, plant biological processes and earthworm activity on the efflux and influx of soil greenhouse gases.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2010.04.004");

The development of microsatellite loci was conducted using the fast isolation by AFLP of sequences containing repeats protocol (FIASCO). Fifteen microsatellite primers (SSR) were used to examine the genetic diversity of a natural population of C. fargesii in Jiulianshan Nature Reserve, Jiangxi Province. The number of alleles varied from four to eight, with a mean value of 6.7 alleles per locus. The mean observed heterozygosity (HO) and expected heterozygosity (HE) were 0.690 and 0.698, ranging from 0.250 to 1.000 and 0.293 to 0.867, respectively. The first estimate of paternity exclusion probability Pr (EX1) varied from 0.043 to 0.527 for individual loci and 0.9972 for the combined loci, when the offspring was sampled but the mother is not. The second estimate, Pr (EX2), ranged from 0.159 to 0.694 for individual loci and 0.9999 for the combined loci, when both the mother and the offspring were sampled.
