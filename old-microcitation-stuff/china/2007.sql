Light was an important environmental factor for the growth of  P. tomentosa seedlings. During the early growth stage of seedlings, basal stem diameter and paripinnate number were decreased with the increasing of shade, taproot length, root : shoot ratio, total dry weight and leaf area per seedling were maximal under 37.3% NS, specific leaf area (SLA) was increased with the increasing of shade, but the relative growth rate was declined. Seedlings grew fastest under 0.6% NS, suggesting that nutrients stored in seeds played an important role at the early growth stage. The treatment of 37.3% NS was best for established seedlings in seedling height, basal stem diameter, paripinnate number, rachis length, the maximum sub-leaflet number of individual paripinnate, leaf area per seedling, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate. Light intensity was positively correlated to total dry weight, and negatively to specific leaf area. The maximum of SLA was observed under 15.5% NS.

The lower levels of maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax), light saturation point (LSP) and light compensation point (LCP), accompanied with no apparent photoinhibition under high light condition in all tested species revealed that their photosynthetic machinery had obvious plasticity in response to low and high light intensity. The instantaneous light use efficiency (ILUE), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) varied with increasing light intensity. A positive correlation between Pn and Gs, and a negative correlation between ILUE and light intensity were observed in the range of light intensity from 500 μmol m-2s-1 to 1 700 μmol m-2s-1. Therefore, Gs and Ci are likely to be the main factors restricting net photosynthesis. However, no significant relationship was observed among leaf　thickness (LT) and water relation parameters (average water loss rate, rehydration rate, instantaneous water use efficiency). The values of Pmax, ILUE, IWUE, LT, leaf area and photosynthetic pigments  (chlorophyll, carotenoid) contents differed pronouncedly among eight species.

At the microspore mother cell stage, there are still few calcium precipitates in cytoplasm, but abundant calcium precipitates accumulate in the tapetal cell walls. After the tetrads form, abundant calcium precipitates appear in the cytoplasm of the microspores and tapetal cells. At the early microspore stage, numerous calcium precipitates accumulate in the microspore intine and abundant precipitates are found in the tapetal cells. At the late microspore stage, calcium precipitates accumulate on the vacuole membrane, but decrease in the tapetal cells. As starch grains accumulate in the mature pollen, very little calcium is found. At the same time, some calcium precipitates accumulate in the parenchymatous cells outside the vascular bundles. The character of calcium distribution during anther development of Jatropha curcas means that calcium plays some roles in biological significance during microspore development. Calcium precipitates are transported from the connective parenchyma cells into the tapetal cells, and they are transported into the pollen wall and cytoplasm.

The forest surface runoff changed in the order of young forest returned farmland (22.934 mm)＞ coniferous forest (17.236 mm)＞needle and broad-leaved mixed forest (10.770 mm)＞evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest (8.876 mm), which is similar to forests in the same or another bio-climate zones. And it is the common character of karst and nonkarst mountainous forests. The karst shrub forest was different from nonkarst in surface runoff due to mother rock properties. Surface runoff of the types was Summer＞Spring＞Autumn＞Winter, coincided with seasonal distribution of precipitation. Seasonal changing rule of surface runoff coefficients in young forest returned farmland was as same as seasonal distribution of surface runoff, and the rule in coniferous forest and needle and broad-leaved mixed forest was Summer＞Spring＞Winter＞Autumn, and the rule in shrub forest and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest was Spring＞Summer＞Winter＞Autumn, and this difference was made by species composition and precipitation distribution. There existed remarkable correlation, accorded to line, between surface runoff in ten days and hydrological factors include precipitation,evaporation and relative humidity, and temperature factors include Max. and Min. and average temperature in air and surface and soil deepth in 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. Results of contribution ratio to surface runoff from multi-variances regression analyses was that temperature is higher than hydrology, and this indicated temperature affected flow of air mass near surface, and influenced further precipitation and forested surface runoff. Influence of layer characteristics in different forest types on annual surface runoff had mutual beneficent and repellency based on community component, structure and development. Annual surface runoff was affected complexly by micro-habitat and surface soil characteristics of plots, and increased by slope of plots rising, and decreased by altitude of plots rising, there had remarkable negative correlation between annual surface runoff and total porosity and capillary pore, and contribution ratio of volume weight to annual surface runoff was -96.54%, based on multi-variances regression analyses.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2007.06.010");

Forty species of bryophytes occurred on trunks, which was much more than those on floor (only 24 species). Bryophyte coverage on trunks and floor was very low. Species richness of floor bryophytes in each plot was between 8 and 13 and the coverage was from 0.59%to 1.12%. The distribution and species richness of floor bryophytes were strongly affected by slope and micro-environments. Epiphytic bryophytes in each plot ranged from 12 to 20 species and the coverage was from 0.63% to 1.63%. This suggested that the species richness and coverage of bryophytes in 30-year-old secondary broadleaved forest have restored to the level of mature broad-leaved forest. Similarity analysis of bryophyte communities indicated that species composition of the mature forest was similar to that of the mixed pine and broad-leaved forest and young secondary forest, but community structure of the former was quite different from the latter. More studies are needed to understand the mechanism of low coverage of floor and epiphytic bryophytes.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2007.06.011");
