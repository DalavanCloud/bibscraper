The areal-type at genera level showed a left-normal change, and common genera for a hyperbola change, which the number of Tropical genera was more than that of Temperate. Due to the difference in latitude and altitude, the number of Tropical genera in Libo and that of Temperate genera in Kaiyang were higher. The ratio of species to families and species to genera in different areas were lower than those in Guizhou Province and China. Percentage of mono-specie families and mono-specie genera expressed oppositely trend.

To understand the phytoplankton community dynamics in these small reservoirs, three pumped storage reservoirs and three non-pumped storage reservoirs were investigated in April, August and December, 2006, respectively. 67 and 56 taxa in total were identified in the pumped and the non-pumped storage reservoirs, respectively. Pseudanabaena sp.、Limnothrix redekei、Cylindrospermopsis rackiborskii only appeared in the pumped storage reservoirs, while Cosmarium sp. only occurred in the non-pumped storage reservoirs. Cells abundance and biomass in the pumped storage reservoirs were higher than those in the non-pumped storage reservoirs. The abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 1.25×105 cell L-1 to 4.38×106 cells L-1 in the pumped storage reservoirs, was mainly dominated by cyanobacteria and small cellular chlorococcacean, while the abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 7.1×104 cells L-1 to 4.61×106 cells L-1in the non-pumped storage reservoirs, and dominated by Cosmarium sp.. The biomass of phytoplankton ranged from 2.3 mg L-1 to 8.8 mg L-1 in the pumped storage reservoirs, and from 1.3 mg L-1 to 5.6 mg L-1 in the non-pumped storage reservoirs. The dominant species were seasonally replaced in the pumped storage reservoirs, while those were seasonally constant in the non-pumped storage reservoirs.

Within a cyme, the 3~4 distal capitula were composed of hermaphroditic florets, while the 1~2 proximal capitula were composed of male florets. There were one pistil and ten stamens in each hermaphroditic floret. Each pistil possessed an inferior ovary containing an anatropous ovule. The male florets had normal stamens, but had no pistil. The pollen vigor in a capitulum reached its peak in the 2nd day after the pollen dispersal. The stigmatic receptivity reached its peak in 3rd and 4th days in the hermaphroditic florets. Stigma lost its receptivity completely on 6th day after it reflexed outward. C. acuminata was hemisynchronously dichogamous, and all florets of a capitulum bloomed synchronously. The male phase came first, in which the stamen matured. Then came the female phase, in which the pistil matured. The female phase of capitula in one order overlapped with the male phase of those in the next order in the same cyme.

The results showed that the P. topengii-E. chinense community belonged to a representative restoration type of the lowland evergreen broad-leaved forest in southern subtropical China. It was found that there were 64 species of vascular plants belonging to 56 genera and 39 families in 20 plots of 2 000 m2, and the floristic components are dominated by Tropical and Subtropical types (94% of the total genera). P. topengii, E. chinense, Aporosa dioica, Machilus chekiangensis and Microdesmis caseariifolia are the dominant tree species. The physiognomy of the community was evergreen, and the life form was dominated by phanerophytes (67.19%). Vertical stratification of community is conspicuous, and can be divided into tree layer, shrub layer, herb layer and liana and epiphyte layer. The species diversity of the community is relatively high with the Margalef richness index of 6.8354, the Shannon diversity index of 3.8874, and the Pielou evenness index of 0.6479. The diversity pattern of Shannon  diversity index in order of tree layer > shrub layer > liana > epiphyte layer > herb layer. The age structure, spatial distribution pattern and interspecific covariation of 10 dominant tree populations in P. topengii-E. chinense community were analyzed, it indicated that there was a change trend in the distribution pattern of dominant tree populations from aggregation to random during the stage of progressive succession.

P. globosa had different toxicity on the five aquatic animals. The survival of B. plicatilis decreased significantly (P<0.05) in algal culture, re-suspension and hemolytic toxins extraction of P. globosa for 72 h, whereas only motility of A. sinica was slightly inhibited by algal culture and re-suspension. Many algal cells in the alimentary canal of A. sinica and B. plicatilis, it suggested P. globosa cell could be fed by them. The algal culture, cell-free medium and cell contents had remarkable effects on the survival of larval E. akaara, but not cell fragments and hemolytic toxins extract of P. globosa, which implied that harmful substances were not attached to the algal cell surface, but inside the algal cell, and that P. globosa could excrete other harmful substances than hemolytic toxins into water to imperil surrounding organisms. After exposured in algal culture, re-suspended cells, filtrate and hemolytic toxins from P. globosa for 72 h, respectively, motilities of M. mongolia were all slightly different from the control though some M. mongolia died during the course. The P. vannamei, exposured in components from P. globosa algal culture for 72 h, were similar to M. mongolia. These suggested that P. globosa had few negative impacts on the survival of M. mongolia and P. vannamei.

Flowering of C. lutea took place from early July to late August. The flowering period of individual lasted about 35~47 days, while anthesis of single flower lasted 6~12 days. Flowers opened at noset time. During anthesis, the pollen viability retained at about 80% and the stigma receptivity retained at about 75%~90%. The mean P/O was 1215.73±266.13. The stigma was obviously higher than the anther after flowering 1 day and reached the entrance of collar tube when the pollen was dispersed, which easily made it to be touched firstly by pollinator and receive allogamy. Field experiments indicated that C. lutea was self-compatible and there was no agamospermy. The pollination must depend upon insects because the occurrence of autonomous self-pollination was difficult. Pollination limitation is existent in this species, so the fruit set in the artificially pollinated flower was higher than that in the open pollinated flower.

The floral characters of the ornithophilous plants in China were mostly generalized to adapt to non-nectarivorous birds. Although most of the ornithophilous genera are tropical components of the Chinese flora, there are several temperate elements of which the diversity centres are in China, such as the genus Rhododendron. Combined with phylogenetic reconstruction of the plant groups, and studies on ornithophily in these taxa, it is possible to elucidate the emergence and evolution of the bird-flower coevolution in the Old World.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.02.017");

Small-size individuals accounted for the majority (>50.4%). To some extent, self-thinning had occurred, as a result of high differentiation of tree height and volume. Tree-status classification structure based on TSTRAT stratification algorithm demonstrated that co-dominant trees represented an overwhelming portion (45.7%) and formed the general canopy of the stand. Value of competition index was the lowest for dominant class, successively followed by co-dominant, intermediate and suppressed class. Gini coefficient value of each class was basically inferior to that of the whole stand. Both in absolute and relative rates, dominant trees grew faster than standard trees before stand maturation. Furthermore, fast-growth stage of DBH for the former lasted longer than that for the latter. At stand level, DBH growth was more seriously restricted than height growth. The general pattern of all stems remained uniform, the same as onset of the plantation. However, occurrence of divergent tree-classes was spatially heterogeneous, with dominant and suppressed class being aggregated, intermediate and dead class randomly scattered, and co-dominant class intervened between randomness and aggregation. Our results suggested that differentiation of tree population was reflected not only in size inequality but also in heterogeneity of spatial configuration. Current stand structure might attribute to intraspecific competition induced by high density.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.02.003");

Hydropathy and transmembrane motif analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that R363 possessed a signal peptide of 27 amino acids at its N-end. The result of the conserved domains analysis indicated that R363 contained five highly conserved regions as well as signature motif of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate sythetase family, which implied that R363 would be a cis-prenyltransferases gene.

REPLACE INTO multilingual(`key`,language,value,guid) values("abstract","en","The flowers of Zingiberaceae have higher degrees of organ fusion and specialization with one functional stamen and two lateral subsidiary structures, which result in controversial explanations on the derivation and nature of the floral organs. However, the origin and course of the floral vasculature may provide credible evidence to understand the nature of floral structures. This paper reported the floral anatomy of Hedychium forrestii Diels with paraffin method. The floral vasculature of H. forrestii is described and the nature of labellum and petaloid subsidiary structures is discussed. The labellum is supposed to represent one member of the outer androecial whorl by the median bundle and two members of the inner whorl by its two lateral traces. While the two petaloid structures, the petaloid staminodes, receive vascular traces of two adaxial sets of carpellary dorsals, representing two inner androecial members. Present evidence is in support of the Thompson and Gregory’s view that the labellum is a triple structure in Zingiberaceae. As in other species of Zingiberaceae, the epigynous glands on the prolongation of the flower in H. forrestii are vascularized emergences of the ovary, which are of modified gynoplural nectary but not androecial member. Comparison with other species studied, the origin and course of floral vasculature are consistent in the tribe Hedychium, which indicated that homeosis played an important role in the evolution of the flower in Zingiberaceae.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.04.001");

The results showed that the members of SIR2 family were localized in the different chromosomes and different parts of Magnaporthe grisea cell, and their encoding proteins all have four sites, such as the protein kinase C phosphorylation site, the Casein kinase II phosphorylation site, the N-glycosylation site, and the N-myristoylation site. The SIR2 HDACs members all haven’t transmembrane regions and they are hydrophilic proteins without signal peptide. The SIR2 HDACs members from M. grisea were aligned by ClustalW2 and their SIR2 domains are highly conserved. These SIR2 HDACs seemed to be involved in processes, such as transcription regulation, energy metabolism and chromatin silencing in M. grisea.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.04.010");

The stigma and anther heights, morphology of pollen grains and stigma, as well as the fruit set after artificial pollination were evaluated. The results showed that individuals of D. sinensis within a population exhibited two floral morphs, viz., long-styled (pin) and short-styled (thrum) morphs. Stigma and anther heights in long-styled flowers are 9.61±0.36 mm and 6.79±0.38 mm, while in the short-styled flowers are 6.11±0.56 mm and 8.96±0.59 mm respectively, exhibiting reciprocal herkogamy. No fruit was produced in treatments with self-pollination and intra-morph pollination, suggesting the occurrence of strong self and intra-morph incompatibility in the species. Ancillary dimorphisms were found in pollen and stigma of the two morphs: the pollen number in pin flowers is significantly smaller than in thrum flowers(38555.6±6258.4 vs. 52145.45±8924.5; t=4.009, P<0.01), the pollen size of pins is also significantly smaller (21.27±0.70 &micro;m vs. 21.92±0.79 &micro;m, t=3.890, P<0.01), although the ovule numbers of the two morphs are similar (38.73±1.85 vs. 39.1±2.25, t=-4.13, P>0.01, pin vs. thrum); while the stigma papillae is larger in long-styled flowers than in short-styled flowers. It was concluded that D. sinensis is a typically distylous species. Floral visitors and their behaviors were also observed, showing that bees (Bombus sp. and Xylocopa magnifica) and butterflies (Graphium sp.) were the main visitors and could efficiently pollinate between morphs in D. sinensis.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.03.010");

There were more small vacuoles, more calcium precipitates and less mitochondria in the sterile pollen mother cells than those in the fertile pollen mother cells. More calcium precipitates were located in the epidermis, endothecium and tapetum of the sterile anther than in those of the fertile anther.

Some large vacuoles appeared in the tapetal cells of the sterile anthers at the early uninucleate pollen stage. All of the sterile pollens possessed malfunctioned exine. The results proposed that the abnormalities of pollen mother cell, the tapetum and the pollen exine, and more calcium precipitates in TGMR rice Peiai 64S under high temperature were related with the pollen abortion.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.03.001");

(Rubiaceae) were studied under light microscopy (LM) and transmissiom electron microscopy (TEM). Flowers of U. hirsuta are monoclinous, which each have five stamens, and the anther is tetralocular. The anther wall is composed of epidermis, endothecium, middle layer(s) and tapetum, the endothecium becomes fibrously thickened at anther dehiscence. The development of the anther wall is the dicotyledonous type, the cytokinesis following meiosis is simultaneous, producing tetrahedral tatrads and rarely isobilateral ones. The exine deposition is initiated during the tetrad stage, and the intine formation begins at vacuolated microspore stage. Mature pollen grains are two-cell type. The ontogenetic features of microsporogenesis and male gametophyte development in U. hirsuta basically follow the pattern of Rubiaceae. The tapetum is secretory type, and dual ontogeny, originating from the parietal layers and connective-derived layer, respectively. Tapetum begins to degenerate at the early stage of free microspore, producing lots of ubisch bodies, and it becomes completely degenerated at anther dehiscence. Protruding onci occur at uninucleate microspore stage, most of which shed during binucleate microspore stage.

The parameters of photosynthesis and biomass of these seedlings were measured. The results showed that the low temperature at high altitude caused dormancy or photosynthetic system destroy. The maximum photosynthesis rate (Pmax) and dry biomass of four seedlings declined significantly along the increment of elevation. The diurnal change pattern of photosynthetic rate of four seedlings at low and middle altitude both showed double-peak type, which the first peak appeared at 11: 00~12: 00 am and the next peak at 4: 00~5: 00 pm, and the first peak was higher significantly at low altitude than that at middle altitude. Except for K. globularia, the root biomass fraction (RMF) of seedlings of the others increased with the increment of altitude. It is concluded that the biomass and photosynthetic rate of these seedlings are mainly limited by temperature, which is the potential reason that these species disappeared in rain forest community at high altitude.

The results showed that the cellular membrane permeability, LOX activity and browning index increased treated with DNP, the saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) increased, and the unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3) and gondoic acid (C20:1), and index of unsaturated fatty acids (IUFA) and unsaturation degree of fatty acids decreased. It suggested that the pericarp browning of longan induced by DNP might be due to increasing LOX activity, enhancing degradation of membrane unsaturated fatty acid and reducing integrity of cellular membrane, which it lead to finally the contact of phenolase with phenolic substrates to produce browning polymers.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2009.05.009");

Therefore, breaking dormancy methods in some Rosa plants were also reviewed, including derestriction and removing inhibitory substances, etc. The environment factors, such as temperature, water and light had important effects on seed dormancy and germination during development and ripening stages. Otherwise, microbial action and the time of hip collection affected seed dormancy and germination of Rosa plants.

The results showed that the full-length cDNA was 1299 bp, with a 1089 bp-length coding sequence (CDS) encoding a protein of 362 amino acids. Blast result showed 74% similarity with the amino acids of Clarkia breweri CbSAMT, confirming that Mikania micrantha SAMT may play a role in methylating SA into MeSA. Therefore this gene was named as MmSAMT and its GenBank accession number was FJ869889. Subsequently the CDS of MmSAMT was integrated into pET-32a(+), then the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Rosetta-gami (DE3) for exogenous expression. A specific monomer about 40 kD could be detected by SDS-PAGE, which was consistent with prediction. Western blot showed that the efficient solubility could be obtained cultured under 20℃,0.05 mmol/L IPTG、180 r min-1 for 6 hours. The transcription profile of MmSAMT in M. micrantha leaves sprayed 100&micro;mol/L SA revealed that it could be activated by SA and reached a peak after 48 hours. It implied that MmSAMT may participate in the SA signaling pathway via MeSA, and induce the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) as a key signal and enhance the plant defense system.
