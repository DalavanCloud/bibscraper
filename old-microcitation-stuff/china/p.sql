The number of capitulum and seed yield per individual in mixed community were significantly different from those in concomitant community, but there were not significant difference between dominant community and two another communities. There was a positive correlation between individual seed yield and plant height, as well as biomass. Seed yield in unit area was positively correlated with the number of flowering plants and capitulum, but was weakly correlated with coverage. In the three communities in arid karst rocky mountain, E. odoratum could produce a large number and light seeds, it indicated that E. odoratum had strong reproductive capacity and displayed strong invasive, and it also could choose the corresponding reproductive strategy according to the environment change, so that it could adapt to environment at large scale.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2011.04.009");

Of the populations checked in C. palustris, the Nayong population from Guizhou has the chromosome number of 2n=32 (tetraploid), and the two Zhongdian populations from Yunnan have the number of 2n=64 (octoploid). Among those checked in C. scaposa, the Hongyuan, Kangding, and Serxu populations from Sichuan all have the tetraploid number of 2n=32, and the Nyingchi population from Xizang and the Deqen population from Yunnan both have the octoploid number of 2n=64. We have performed a karyotypic analysis on most of these populations. The present results, together with those reported previously, show that both C. palustris and C. scaposa from China may have undergone strong differentiation among populations in ploidy level and karyotypic constitution. Caltha palustris from China includes at least three cytotypes with different ploidy levels, namely, the tetraploid cytotype with 2n=32, the hexaploid cytotype with 2n=48, and the octoploid cytotype with 2n=64. The tetraploid cytotype is the commonest and the most widespread, and currently only in northwestern Yunnan all the three cytotypes have been found to co-occur. Caltha scaposa from China includes two cytotypes, the tetraploid cytotype with 2n=32 and the octoploid cytotype with 2n=64, with the former occurring in the northeastern part of the geographical range of the species while the latter in the southwestern part. Although the 32 or 64 chromosomes in both C. palustris and C. scaposa can be roughly arranged into eight groups of four or eight homologues, in some of the groups there often exists obvious heteromorphy among the presumably homologous chromosomes, and thus different populations are more or less distinct in karyotypic constitution. Although C. palustris and C. scaposa are the two most closely related species in the genus, they are revealed to be rather well differentiated chromosomally, particularly in chromosome size. The chromosomes in C. scaposa are smaller than those in C. palustris, which may represent a derived condition.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2013.01.003");

The results showed that the biomass of leaves, branches, stem, roots, bark and total biomass increased with increasing age. The ratio of leaf, branch and bark biomass to total biomass decreased with age, while the ratio of stem biomass to total biomass increased. Biomass of 1- to 4-yearold individual and stands ranged from 4.32 to 66.29 kg, and 10.68 to 153.33 t hm-2, respectively. Biomass structure characteristics revealed that Eucalyptus plantation began to closure at the 4th year, and stem growth was dominant. Gross calorific values had significant difference (P<0.01) among five components, such as leaf, branch, root, stem and bark, with ranged from 17.23 kJ g-1 for bark to 20.56 kJ g-1 for leaf, those of the same component had no significant differences among different ages (P>0.05). The retained energy of 1- to 4-year-old individual and stands ranged from 81.61 to 1255.22 MJ and 201.83 to 2903.32 GJ hm-2, respectively, the change trend and orders of components were the same as biomass.

Erythrophleum fordii has brightly colorful inflorescences and sends forth delicate odor, its pollen is coated by strong mucous substance and its stigmas have not specific structure for pollen capturing, and meanwhile the inflorescences pollinated by wind did not fruit at all, therefore it was inferred that E. fordii might be entomophilous. According to genetic analyses and fruiting of two object trees under contrasting reproductive situations, E. fordii can be selfing occasionally but out-crossing is dominant with out-crossing rate in the Dinghushan E. fordii community for 90.6%.

Intra-genomic polymorphism was detected in the internal transcribed spacer (including ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) regions of these species. The analyses of G+C content, 5.8S conserved motifs and minimum free energy of 5.8S secondary structures suggested that there were putative pseudogenes of nrDNA in these species. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences resulted in five clades with variants from the same accession commonly being placed in two or more clades and species were grouped differently among clades. These results demonstrated the existence of incomplete concerted evolution of ITS within individuals of Syncarpea, which could be explained by incomplete lineage sorting, possible hybridization or polyploidy and resulted in the polymorphism of ITS and the difficulty in morphology-based species delineation in the subgenus.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2013.01.004");

REPLACE INTO multilingual(`key`,language,value,guid) values("abstract","en","The interaction between pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae) and their host fig trees (Ficus) is a striking example of an obligate pollination mutualism. Successful pollination of fig trees depends on a specific species of fig wasp managing to find figs of the correct host plant, at their correct stage of development. Encounters between receptive figs and their pollinators are attained by figs emitting species-specific volatile chemicals to attract their fig wasps. However, whether and how the choice of fig wasps can be influenced by the characteristics of receptive figs are still controversial. The female phase of Fiucs sermicordata was deemed by whether fig wasps were willing to enter figs, the different developmental phase of male and female figs in receptivity were acquired at the same time by preventing figs from being pollinated by fig wasps, and the diameter of figs was also measured to examined how fig wasps preferences can be reflected by the size, developmental phase and gender of figs. The results showed that figs would keep growing if they were prevented from being pollinated during female phase, smaller figs were more likely to be entered by more fig wasps for both male and female figs, and fig wasps preferred younger figs. Some of fig wasps still chose female figs to enter when both receptive male and female figs were accessible at the same time, although the wasps number was significantly smaller than those of entering male figs. Although the correlation between fig diameter and foundress number was positive within figs in the same developmental phase, such correlation only significant among four treatments of male figs. The results were not consistent with Ficus pertusa and Ficus hispida. These implied that different Ficus species might have different mechanism to control their pollinator's choice during female phase, it is developmental phase in receptivity and the change of chemical volatile as consequence rather than fig diameter has the direct effect on the choice of fig wasps, and fig wasps depend on olfactory rather than visual cue to locate their host figs. The results could help for further understand the stabe mechanisms of fig-fig wasps.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.01.002");

Sorghum species distribute in the tropical and subtropical to temperate regions, with the species number being 22, 15, 9, 3, 2 in Australia, Asia, Africa, Europe, and Mediterranean, respectively. In addition, six species have extended to the Americas. In China, five species distribute in northeastern, southwestern, and southern provinces. Among five subgenera of Sorghum, only subgen. Sorghum has representatives in the New World, other subgenera are restricted to the Old World. The subgen. Sorghum presents in Africa then spread to tropical and temperate regions around the world, subgen. Parasorghum extends from Africa, Asia to Australia, subgen. Stiposorghum occurrs in Australia and Asia, subgen. Chaetosorghum is found in Australia, and subgen. Heterosorghum is found in Australia and Aisa.

The results showed that the length of matK, rbcL, trnL-F and psbA-trnH fragments were 1026 - 1142 bp, 1156 - 1178 bp, 744 - 822 bp, 355 - 599 bp, respectively. According to the phylogenetic tree constructed by Bayesian Inference and PAUP 4.0b10 software, it was indicated that the genetic relationship of D. bulbifera in Yunnan was close to D. zingibiernsis, D. sinopatviflorawas close to D. zingibiernsis, while that of D. bulbifera in Africa was far to D. bulbifera in Yunnan. In addition, it couldn't be completely distinguished D. sinopatvifloraand D. zingibiernsis in the phylogenic tree by 4 combined fragments.

According to importance values of species in tree layer, 41 surveying plots in the Reserve were divided into 6 types, such as Lindera communis-Liquidambar formosana forest, Loropetalum chinense-Pinus massoniana forest, Acer sp.-Celtis tetrandra subsp. sinensis forest, Koelreuteria minor-Platycarya strobilacea forest, Cornus controversa-C. parviflora forest and Dendrobenthamia japonica var. chinensis-Cyclobalanopsis glauca forest. The results showed that SOM had significant difference between A or B stratum of soil among forest types, and the species number, diameter, height and density, as well as Margalef index, Simpson index, Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou index of different forest types also had difference significance. The soil porosity, water storage capacity and main fertility indexes increased with SOM increment. Plant diversity indexes of tree layer had positive relationship with SOM, especially significant correlation with SOM in A stratum of soil, and Simpson index and Pielou index with significant correlation to SOM in B stratum of soil, while those in shrub layer and herb layer had no significant correlation with SOM. Multivariate analysis showed that total contribution rate of plant diversity indexes to SOM in A stratum of soil was in the order of shrub layer > tree layer > herb layer, and that to SOM in B stratum of soil was herb layer > tree layer > shrub layer.

The results showed that the DOM content, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), increased with fluctuation along leaching time from 3 to 24 hours. DOC content of fresh leaves of DID was significantly higher than that in PIM (P<0.01), while DON and DOP are lower. The special ultraviolet-visible absorption (SUVA) and humification index (HIX) of DOM in F layer litter of both species was significantly higher than that in fresh leaves and L layer litter, it indicated that F layer litter contained more aromatic substances and high humification degree. Synchronous fluorescence peak showed DOM contained protein-like and fulvic acid-like fiuorophore. The six kinds of samples showed five IR absorption bands in common, with the strongest absorption in all cases arising from stretching vibration of H-bonding hydroxyl groups. The infrared absorption differences between three kinds of samples in the same stand supported that the conjugated systems grown larger from the fresh leaves to L layer litter to F layer litter.

The results showed that the average height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and wood volume among families had significant differences. The average height, diameter and wood volume growth of families were genetic controlled at medium level or above, which indicated high selection potential among or within families. Wood volume had large variation among families, followed by DBH and height. Family heritability and individual heritability gradually decreased with age increasing, and stabilized at 7- to 9-year-old. The genetic correlation coefficient of growth traits gradually increased with age increasing, and reached maximum at 7 years old and then tended to stable. The genetic correlation coefficients of plant height, DBH and wood volume were 0.9602, 0.9340 and 0.9849, respectively, so that 7-year-old was suitable age for early selection of families. Combined with early selection and character indexes, ten superior families of 11-year-old were selected, their average height, DBH and wood volume were 13.95 m, 14.34 cm and 0.1229 m3, respectively, and their genetic gains were 12.24%, 18.69% and 51.59%, respectively. Compared with contrast of the superior provenance, the 10 selected superior families showed certain advantage on tree form qualities, such as stem straightness, fullness, branching angle, the biggest branch and crown breadth, which increased from 7.71% to 12.94%.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.03.009");

The effects of additives with different concentrates and culture time on growth and polysaccharide content of D. officinale PLBs were studied. The results showed that the PLBs proliferation, differentiation and the polysaccharide content were influenced by four additives. The proliferation rate of PBLs reached up to 146.1% supplemented with 15.0 g L-1 sugarcane bagasse and cultured for 60 d. The polysaccharide content of PLBs was increased for 50.4% supplemented with 20.0 g L-1 sugarcane bagasse and cultured for 40 days. So it was suggested that sugarcane bagasse was suitable additive for in vitro D. officinale PLBs owing to promote the growth of D. officinale PLBs and reduce cost of production.","10.3969/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.03.007");

Under F stress, the fluorescence parameters, such as RC/CSo, ETo/ABS, REo/ETo, REo/ABS, PIabs and PIcs decreased in tea leaves, while VJ, VI, DIo/RC, DIo/CSo, DIo/ABS and dissipated energy increased. There were negative correlations between F content in tea leaves and ETo/TRo, REo/ABS and PICS, but a positive correlation with DIo/RC. Therefore, the ability of photosynthetic electron transfer in tea leaves was weakened under F stress, the whole electron transport chain from PSII to PSI was affected, meanwhile, leaves could prevent light suppression and light damage by increasing heat dissipation itself.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.06.005");

Therefore, it was suggested that D. dichotoma could be a potential indicator of soil P availability in subtropical forests.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.06.004");

The results showed that the membrane permeability (MP), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and endogenous ABA content in ‘Shenglibaihao’ infected by R. solanacearum increased markedly, but chlorophyll (Chl) content, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr) and stomatal conductance (Gs) obviously decreased. Besides, the integrity of chloroplast membrane system was damaged, the number of chloroplast decreased, and expansion to collapse, the grana lamella loosed and disintegrated, and starch grains got smaller in ‘Shenglibaihao’ leaves affected. In contrast, for ‘Xiangshu 75-55', the changes in the related physiological indexes were not different significantly, and the plasma membrane and lamellar still kept integration. Therefore, there were distinct differences in the PMP, Chl content, ABA content, Pn and chloroplast structure between the two sweet potato varieties with different disease-resistance.","10.11926/j.issn.1005-3395.2014.06.009");

Because of the longtime taxonomic debate and confusion about the taxonomy of Hedyotis-Oldenlandia complex, the scientific names of Baihuasheshecao components were treated under the genus of either Oldenlandia or Hedyotis in practice. In order to clarify the nomenclatural confusion, a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis was conducted on basis of seven plastid loci and two nuclear gene regions from the selected 85 taxa in the tribe Spermacoceae (Rubiaceae). The results demonstrated that O. diffusa should not be a member of Oldenlandia L. but Scleromitrion (Wight & Arn.) Meisn.
