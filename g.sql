UPDATE publications SET abstract="Citharichthys gilberti Jenkins and Evermann, a common eastern Pacific flatfish, is known from Guaymas and Baja California, Mexico, south to Peru (Miller, 1966). It attains a total length of at least 260 mm (Meek and Hildebrand, 1928), frequently occurs on muddy bottoms and may enter rivers or other brackish water environments. Despite wide distribution there are apparently few literature references to the species and little is known of its life history or development. During a recent trip to the Pacific coast of Panama, C. gilberti was found to be the most abundant flatfish taken at a number of poisoned inshore and intertidal stations. Sufficient specimens were obtained over a broad size range, 18-193 mm SL, to permit the present report on meristic and morphometric characteristics of the isthmian population."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Several workers and several lines of evidence have shown that the shrimp life cycle is very short, probably about 15 to 16 months, for the very small fraction reaching the largest adult size. Additionally, a great deal of commercial fishing is carried out upon sub-adult populations within the bays and shallow Gulf. In fact most shrimp that are caught have never spawned. These shrimp grow up within one warm season and they are derived from larvae which make their way to inside waters from the offshore spawning areas. Thus, it has been surmised for a long time that prediction of at least the relative abundance of the future shrimp could be deduced from studies of the numbers of young or juvenile shrimp in the bays right after they have completed their larval immigration. The first work on this problem was carried out by Baxter (1962) at the Galveston Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. He sampled one area at the entrance of Bolivar Pass, leading into Galveston Bay, with a beam trawl. Work at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi Sound was carried out under contract with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and was initiated on 1 November 1962. The contract was terminated on 31 October 1964, although the work has been carried out on a reduced scale since that time. The present report covers the period of the contract."

Collections were made in the littoral and shallow off shore waters of the Gulf of Mexico from Dauphin Island, Alabama, westward to West Bay, Louisiana, at intervals throughout a five year period. Using standard paraffin techniques a number of staining methods were employed. Cytological and histological accounts are presented of the tissue elements of the gonads beginning with inception in the larvae, sexual differentiation to the sexes, and the cyclic changes associated with oogenesis and spawning in the mature fish. The microscopic developments occurring during these periods are correlated with gross features of the organ, the ages of specimens, and with seasonal periods. An account of the morphology and physiology of atretic oocytes and ovulated follicles is presented. Using the ovarian components as an index, the time and duration of the spawning season is established as occurring from late October to February or early March with some variance due to environmental factors. From the study it is possible to postulate that this species exhibits intermittent total spawning in the Gulf." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0204.01";

UPDATE publications SET abstract="A breeding population of Syngnathus scovelli was discovered in 1960 in Lake St. John near Ferriday, Louisiana, which is over 300 river miles from the Gulf of Mexico by the shortest possible route. Although S. scovelli has been known to be euryhaline, this constitutes the first record of a breeding population in fresh water. This study encompassed the period from July 1960 through February 1966. During this time S. scovelli were maintained for varying periods of time in fresh water aquaria. The longest period of time any one specimen lived in captivity was from 29 September 1960 until 16 November 1962, almost 27 months. The chief limiting factor to the maintenance of S. scovelli in fresh water aquaria appears to be a ready supply of live plankton for food. The breeding process of brackish water specimens was observed and is described. Gestation took 12 days in two males in August and both males bred the day after giving birth to a previous brood. Young S. scovelli measured 12 mm at birth. This is the first report of the length of newly born S. scovelli in the literature. A size range of 12-160 mm in length was noted for the species. A very rapid growth rate has been noted in the young from 12-80 mm, but growth slowed greatly at 80 mm. Three apparent year classes have been postulated among the specimens of S. scovelli collected in Lake St. John. These were: 0 (12-80 mm) , 1 (80-120 mm) , and 2 (120-160 mm) . Consecutive monthly data have not been consistent enough to prove this. Failure to collect these data may be due in great measure to the rotenone placed in Lake St. John by the Louisiana Wild Life and Fisheries Commission on 12 October 1961. The fresh water population from Lake St. John showed less variation in meristic characters than did the fish from Mississippi Sound." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0204.02";

UPDATE publications SET abstract="From June 1955 through May 1957, stations on three oyster reefs were sampled quantitatively at intervals and all oysters and associated macroscopic organisms were recorded per unit area. Station I was a privately leased “natural” reef, consisting of higher places exposed at low water, with a salinity range of 22.7-36.6 o/oo and was fairly productive. Station II, depth ca. two meters, was the least saline, range 1.2-29.3 o/oo, and was considered very productive for natural reef. Station III, depth one meter, salinity range 7.5-35.7 o/oo, was depleted although there was an abundant spatfall. Depth and bottom types as well as salinity were found to delimit certain species of animals. Analysis of past records showed that the bay had formerly been less saline; there was an extended drought in the watershed before and during the investigation. As a result several species of animals less euryhaline than oysters became established on some of the reefs. At Station III, two serious oyster enemies, Thais haemastoma Say and Menippe mercenaria Conrad were abundant. A field experiment at this station during the second year pointed to these two enemies as the main cause of the depletion of the reef. Near the end of the investigation rainfall became more nearly normal and the lowest salinities were recorded at this time. The reduction in salinity, especially at Station III, eliminated many of the less euryhaline species, including drills and stone crabs, and the reef later regained its former productivity."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The basic purpose of this work was to gain information on the possible role of some Rhode Island estuaries as nursery grounds for young migrant and resident species of fishes. The areas selected were, the lower Pettaquamscutt River and the lower Point Judith Pond, both in the town of Narragansett, Rhode Island. The seining operations were carried through summer and early fall of 1962 when these estuaries are heavily used as nursery grounds. Major features of the occurrence, abundance and distribution of young fishes were deduced by examining samples from seine hauls. Thirty-six species were recorded from the lower river while only twenty-four species occurred in the lower pond. The abundance of fishes rose with a rise in temperature and declined with decreasing temperature, but no correlation was observed between maximum temperature and maximum number of individuals occurring at any time. The number of species and the abundance of individual fish were highest at the seaward station (Sta. II) in the lower river. Among the selected species, the abundance of Menidia menidia was two to three times higher at Middle Bridge (Sta. II) than at any other station. The behavior of Pseudopleuronectes americanus, found primarily at seaward stations, and the migrant species Brevoortia tyrannus observed at landward stations, is discussed. The species P. americanus grew at the rate of 10 mm per month, but exhibited no variation in growth in the two estuarine systems. The populations of B. tyrannus from the lower Pettaquamscutt River had a growth rate that was almost twice that of populations in the lower Point Judith Pond. The growth rate of these species in Rhode lsland waters compare favorably with similar data from other studies. The juvenile M. menidia demonstrated a higher rate of growth at seaward stations in both the areas, especially in the lower river. Forty-three types of prey organisms belonging to diverse taxonomic groups were identified from stomach contents of P. americanus and thirty-nine types were noted in the gut contents of M. menidia. Amlysis of the degree of fullness indicated markedly high percentage of full stomachs in the two study areas. However the degree of fullness was comparatively less in fish occurring in the lower pond. The scarcity of food in the lower pond, apparently forced M. menidia (51-80 mm) to feed upon phytoplankton as a substitute food or “forced diet”.

Photographs of one animal taken from a helicopter showed an otariid seal. In late June a light colored otariid seal began to reside on the buoys of the ship channel leading into Mobile Bay. It stayed there about two and a half weeks. The animal was a light tan in color and was a female, with a large healing scar on the right side. It was formerly reported from buoys off Cedar Key, Florida, and a newspaper photo verified that account. The animal was similar in all respects to the California sea lion. It washed up on the beach of the Chandeleur Islands of Louisiana with a bullet hole in it and badly decomposed on 11 August 1966. On 3 April 1967 another sea lion, possibly the second Louisiana specimen, was photographed off Pensacola.

Pieces of the parchment-like worm tube of Chaetopterus variopedatus (Renier) were caught in the meshes of the net and were also collected. A small bivalve mollusk, Notocorbula operculata (Philippi 1848) was found to be attached to most of the Chaetopterus tubes. Microscopic examination showed that the bivalves were attached at the anterior ventral margin with a byssal thread.

Brittlestars at densities of 300 and 600 individuals m-2 caused a twofold increase in the rate that Li was transported through the sediment.

A total of 274 red drum (4.00 - 19.99 mm SL) and 205 Atlantic croaker (8.00 - 17.99 mm SL) were used for this analysis. Of the red drum stomachs examined, 8.4% were empty while 28.8% of Atlantic croaker stomachs contained no food. Major prey items identified for both species were calanoid copepods, harpacticoid copepods and mysid shrimp across all size classes. Ontogenetic trophic niche shifts were detected for red drum and Atlantic croaker. Type and quantity of food ingested by red drum were similar across all stations (Aransas Bay Station: 1H, 2T and 3H) examined. Atlantic croaker ingested the same types of prey at all stations, but contained varying quantities of food throughout the study area. In general, high dietary overlap was observed between red drum and Atlantic croaker with most overlap values (Schoener’s index) exceeding 70%." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.1001.05";

The fish measured 412 mm FL, weighed 824 g and was determined to be 4 years old by otolith analysis. Gross examination of the gonads revealed four lobes: right and left ovaries and right and left testis which represents a unique occurrence among hermaphroditic fish. All lobes ended in a common sperm duct/oviduct with the exception of the left ovary which had no oviduct. Both ovaries contained vitellogenic oocytes and both testis had freely running spermatozoa. Histological examination showed many oocytes undergoing final oocyte maturation, the presence of some post ovulatory follicles and lobules full of tailed spermatozoa. There was no evidence of the intermingling of sperm and oocytes within the gonad. The capture of this fish on the spawning grounds and the advanced stage of both ovarian and testicular development suggests spawning probably would involve the release of both oocytes and spermatozoa."

The Mississippi Academy of Sciences officially dedicated the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL) with the opening of the first summer session at Magnolia State Park in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, on August 28, 1947. Mississippians in scientific and educational circles had worked for two decades toward creating a research and educational laboratory focused on the state’s marine and coastal environments. The Academy’s priorities were scholarly research and education. Political leaders were interested in the potential for a direct effect on the economy of Mississippi. The evolution of that two-fold focus has created a unique institution that integrates scientific discovery with graduate, undergraduate and public education as well as with rapid and effective response to questions of public concern."

In this study we examined apostome trophonts (the diagnostic stage) from a variety of crustacean hosts in the Mobile Bay and Dauphin Island, Alabama, area. The hosts were grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio and P. paludosus), striped hermit crab (Clibanarius vittatus), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), and pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus (=Penaeus) duorarum). A number of similar but distinct morphotypes of apostomes were present, those corresponding to descriptions of species of Hyalophysa as well as variant forms. The morphotypes observed in this study had the following characteristics: variations in the formation of the anterior ventral field of kinetosomes from falciform field 9; variations in the degree to which ciliary row 1 (kinety 1) was separated into 2 segments; and variations in the development of kinety a. A record of the variant morphotypes that do not correspond exactly to an established species should prove useful to biologists attempting to identify apostomes from crustacean molts. We choose not to name the variant forms as new species because they exist as different morphotypes within a population of cells, because some of these types occur in low frequency, and because one of the variant forms changes from one morphotype to another."

Highest mean medusae abundance was observed over the fore-reef zone and in daytime samples. Lowest abundances occurred in the reef lagoon and at dusk. Seventeen species were identified, with Liriope tetraphylla, Aglaura hemistoma, Cubaia aphrodite, and Sarsia prolifera being the most abundant. They belong to a group of medusae dominant along the world&#039;s second largest barrier reef. Cluster analysis revealed primary (fore-reef) and secondary (reef lagoon, channel) oceanic groups, showing the strong oceanic influence along and across the reef system. Day-to-day variation in the reef medusan community seemed relatively unimportant. The community structure of the reef medusa fauna appeared to be quite uniform despite the expected migratory behavior of these predators, tidal exchange across the reef, introduction of oceanic species, and time of day. The species composition was most closely related to that of the Campeche Bank and oceanic Caribbean waters. Dominance of oceanic medusae within the reef lagoon was attributed to the narrowness of the continental shelf and the mesoscale hydrological features of the zone." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.1101.05";

Stage IV embryos (6-day-old) were exposed to 0.5 µg/L of DFB for 4 days followed by transfer into clean seawater for the rest of the incubation period. The photoresponses of light-adapted larvae from untreated embryos and embryos treated with 0.5 µg/L DFB were monitored from 1 day through 8 day post hatch for phototactic responses to 500 nm light. Larvae from untreated embryos exhibited strong positive phototaxis at high light intensities (3 x 10-2 and 3 x 10-1 Wm-2) but became negatively phototactic at lower light intensities (3 x 10-5 to 3 x 10-3 Wm-2). This phototactic pattern continued during the monitoring period. On the other hand, larvae from DFB-treated embryos exhibited altered phototaxis for the first 3 days. Alterations were especially evident on Day 1, as larvae were only negatively phototactic. By Day 4, these larvae reverted to the normal pattern of photoresponses shown by untreated larvae. These results indicated that the alterations in photoresponses of larvae caused by embryonic exposure to DFB are only transitory and can be corrected within 4 days of hatching if the larvae are exposed to water lacking DFB."

In respect to the fishes certain biological and physical factors were noted. Forty-nine collecting stations were established on the island, and these were categorized according to the nature of their appearance and location. A salinity range from fresh to 29.9 ppt. was recorded for the sampled bodies of water, with the high salinity areas being under the influence of Mississippi Sound waters. Fishes with both marine and brackish water affinities were collected. Euryhaline species were taken from both fresh water and water which was approaching fresh; however, no true fresh water fishes were obtained. Members of the Atherinidae, Cyprinodontidae, and Poeciliidae (Menidia beryllina, Cyprinodon variegatus, Fundulus similis, Gambusia affinnis, and Poecilia latipinna) contributed most conspicuously to the fish population. Other families which were encountered formed somewhat less conspicuous elements in the population.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The apparent habitat isolation of the mudshrimps Callianassa islagrande Schmitt and Callianassa jamaicense louisianensis Schmitt (Anomura : Thalassinidea) in Mississippi Sound is a function of species-related differences in ability to burrow and survive in the significantly different substrates of each habitat. C. islagrande is found only in sand bottomed beaches of the offshore barrier islands, whereas C. j. louisianensis is found only in the muddy backwaters of the mainland and Deer Island. Both forms produce deep and extensive permanent or semipermanent burrows in their respective habitat and are probably of some significance in sediment turnover. Laboratory studies show that C. j. louisianensis can only burrow efficiently in mud and cannot burrow or survive in sand unless there is sufficient available mud with which this form constructs its burrow walls. The inability of C. islagrande to tolerate silt limits its ability to burrow and survive in mud. For this reason C. islagrade cannot inhabit the muddy inshore waters. The poor burrowing efficiency of C. j. louisianensis in sand is due to a mechanical inability to handle uncohesive sand grains. The foliaceous third maxillipeds and comparatively larger second and third pereipods of C. islagrande (compared with those of C. j. louisianensis) are adaptations to a sandy habitat, enabling greater burrowing efficiency per unit of effort. Adults and juveniles exhibited the same behavior patterns in aquarium studies. Settling juveniles probably exhibit the same behavior pattern as adults and juveniles."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The presence of disjunct species of animals on either side of the Florida peninsula has been reported by a number of authors. The littorinid mollusk, Littorina irrorata Say, which has a range from Massachusetts to the Rio Grande of Texas, except for south Florida, is one such species (Bequaert 1943). The marsh crab, Sesarma cinereum (Bosc), is another example of an animal with a distribution from Virginia to the western Gulf of Campeche except for a break in southern Florida (Rathbun, 1918). Williams (1965) lists 23 species of crustaceans having interrupted distribution at the Florida peninsula. This report on discovery of a breeding population of the Carolina marsh clam, Polymesoda caroliniana (Bosc) in southern Florida supports the contention by Hedgpeth (1953) that at least some, perhaps many, of the disjunct records may be a result of insufficient collecting in south Florida. The Carolina marsh clam has been assumed to be a typical disjunct species since it was described as such by van der Schalie (1933). It was not included in Marine Shells of Southwest Florida by Perry (1940) nor in Florida Marine Shells by Vilas and Vilas (1945). Abbott (1954) apparently knew of no southern Florida material, and recent examination of collections of this species in the E. S. National Museum provided no material south of New Smyrna on the east coast or Fort Myers on the west coast of Florida. Gunter and Hall (1963) found a breeding colony in the St. Lucie River estuary near Fort Pierce, Florida extending the range nearly 275 km farther south along the Florida east coast but gave no details on the size of the population. The initial discovery of a single valve of the Carolina marsh clam in extreme southern Florida was made by Tabb and Manning (1961) in deltaic muds at the mouth of the East River where it enters Whitewater Bay in Everglades National Park. Since 1962 sufficient discoveries have been made in Everglades National Park to prove the existence of a breeding population occupying two rather different but adjoining habitats over an extensive area of southern coastal marsh."

In this particular study it was felt that the hydrocarbons would yield the most significant organic geochemical information. These compounds are ubiquitous but minor components of all organisms. Though their function is not entirely understood, it is known that they are concentrated in the waxy coatings of plants and most likely aid in the protective mechanisms of plants. Among the several classes of biochemical materials, the hydrocarbons exhibit probably the greatest resistance to biological and chemical degradation and therefore may be preferentially concentrated and preserved in sedimentary environments. An extreme variety of specific hydrocarbons occurs naturally in plants and hence the possible combinations and distributions of these hydrocarbons are limitless.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The nongaseous substances that normally move in and out of cells are metabolites, water and salts. The common salts in water determine its salinity, and the definition of sea water salinity and its composition are discussed. The relationships of salinity to all phyla of animals living in the coastal waters are reviewed, with emphasis on the estuaries of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which are particularly influenced by coastal engineering works and changes of salinity caused thereby. The fauna of estuaries is made up of a few brackish water species which complete their life cycles there, marine species which spend only a part of their life cycles there and which have definite low-salinity limits, a few anadromous species passing through, and a few fresh water species with high salinity limits. Organisms of marine origin are dominant. Floods and drought periods, resulting in severe osmotic changes, may kill organisms or result in drastic changes of the biota, which may take extended time to reestablish itself, if the conditions return to normal. Many invertebrate animals have few mechanisms for controlling the movement of waters and salts across their external membranes and thus are osmotic conformers. Species that cannot withstand wide salinity change are said to be stenohaline, but many species can tolerate rather wide changes; they have broad tolerance at a cellular level. Osmoregulators exhibit considerable control of their internal salinity by excretory mechanisms and permeability control of the body surface to water and salts. In general, the worms and molluscs are more often osmoconformers than the crustaceans, the latter having greater control over their internal osmotic environment than other invertebrate groups. Effects upon different stages of life history are different, but in general the limiting effects of salinity and other environmental factors bear upon the reproductive stages or the young. The limits of salinities are nearly always on the lower side with regard to estuarine organisms. Aside from osmotic adjustments, animals react to salinity changes by closing their shells, closing their burrows, burying in the bottom where interstitial water has higher salinity, or motile forms simply move out. In spite of these adjustments, none may be successful during large floods. The salinity relationships of all phyla are reviewed, even though some of them are unimportant parts of the marine populations.

It was planned to sample monthly six fixed offshore stations at depths ranging from 5 to 50 fathoms in the open Gulf. In general this was carried out fairly well. Water samples were taken from surface, midwater, and bottom levels each time a station was occupied, and temperatures and salinities were recorded for each of these. Samples were tested for the presence of nitrates, nitrites, ortho-phosphates and total phosphates. Secchi disc extinction points were recorded. Grab samples were taken for the determination of bottom composition. Plankton samples were taken from surface, midwater and bottom levels. Copepods, brachyuran zoea and megalops, stomatopod larvae, Lucifer faxoni, Acetes a. carolinae, Penilia avirostris, Doliolum sp. and fish eggs and larvae were present in greatest abundance. Surface and benthic nekton samples were obtained. Dredge samples were made quarterly and twelve invertebrate species and three species of fishes were collected. Renilla mülleri was the most abundant species taken, and the fish catch consisted of Centropristes ocyurus, Citharichthys spilopterus and Etropus crossotus. Accounts of 50 invertebrate species (24,679 specimens) and 129 fishes (93,563 specimens) taken in trawl hauls is presented. Temperature and salinity data are given for all species. Relative abundance, seasonal bathymetric distributions and movements, apparent growth patterns, catch per unit of effort and various biological data are noted for the most abundant species. Station 5 (40 fathoms) produced the largest percentage of trawl catches (22.7). Renilla mülleri was the most abundant invertebrate taken in trawling. The brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, was second in abundance (10.92%). The five most abundant species comprising 80.57% numerically of the catch were croaker, longspine porgy, butterfish, spot, and seatrout. The species comprising 91.89% of the catch by weight were the croaker, longspine porgy, spot, seatrout, lizardfish, butterfish, pinfish, bank sea bass, sea catfish and black fin sea robin.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The most useful aquatic areas in the world are in serious danger of destruction. The estuaries, where fresh water, land and sea meet in a dynamic and highly productive zone, are today gravely threatened through unwise and unplanned excessive use of their valuable but finite capacities. Estuaries include the coastal zone which is affected by both the run-off of fresh water from the land and the salt water from the sea. This zone includes tidal rivers, marshes, bays and river mouths. The value of these estuarine regions has been well established by biologists. However, this value is fully appreciated by only a handful of people. The intense uses to which the coastal zone is being placed are so expansive, so competitive and potentially so destructive. Much shipping for industrial and military purposes begins and ends in estuaries. The waste products of the industries which crowd the coastal zone and of one-third of the population of this country are daily being poured into these waters. Estuaries are directly linked to suitable conditions needed for the development of three-fourths of the fish and shellfish taken for food production and recreational fishing. In addition, the use of these so important coastal regions is ever increasing by our growing population for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Each of the above uses is an important human use. However, each of these uses is potentially destructive. Even aesthetic uses, which have heretofore been above reproach, can irretrievably destroy this fragile ecosystem when vast areas are developed for housing projects by dredging and filling in the land. In fact, this action may destroy the very reason why people wish to move to the shore. All of these uses, and others, have developed without sufficient comprehension of their effects and interactions and totally without planning for an optimal balance for present and future human uses. Present and potential human uses involve vast and complicated economic problems, political and geographic difficulties, and grave social and legal complications. It is with the latter, the legal problems of wetlands preservation and utilization, that this paper is concerned." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0402.09";

UPDATE publications SET abstract="In January 1973, large numbers of Mugil cephalus (striped mullet), weighing approximately 250 gm each, died in two freshwater localities in tidewater bayous of Jackson County, Mississippi. Fish identified as Mugil curema, M. cephalus, Megalops atlantica, Dormitator maculatus, and Fundulus grandis were found dead in other low saline estuarine areas. Fish-kills during cold periods are less commonly encountered in Mississippi than in Texas or Florida. This particular incident is attributed to conditions of stress for fishes incompletely acclimated to the encountered low temperatures. The most deleterious stress was the low saline water which probably allowed a breakdown in the fishes’ ion-osmoregulatory mechanisms. Striped mullet and other euryhaline fishes in salinities greater than 6 ppt survived, as did freshwater centrarchids and ictalurids in areas with dying mullet. Other stresses thought to contribute to the weakening of striped mullet in Paige Bayou during the period of rapidly decreasing temperatures include starvation and high levels of pesticide residues. In examined fish, the alimentary tracts were devoid of food, the gall bladders were distended and leaking bile, the livers contained excess lipid material and were often stained throughout with bile pigments, and the levels of DDT metabolites and endrin residues in the liver were higher than in control fish.

Gunter and Christmas (1973) described the events leading to the stranding of a baleen whale on Ship Island, Mississippi, in 1968, giving the species as Balaenoptera physalus, the Rorqual. Unfortunately the identification was in error, but fortunately good photographs were shown. The underside of the tail was a splotched white, but there was no black margin. The specimen also had fewer throat and belly grooves than the Rorqual, as a comparison with True’s (1904) photograph shows. Dr. James Mead (in litt.) pointed out that the animal was a Sei Whale, Balaenoptera borealis. This remains a new Mississippi record and according to Lowery’s (1974) count, it is the fifth specimen reported from the Gulf of Mexico. The stranding of a sixth Sei Whale on Anclote Keys in the Gulf, west of Tarpon Springs, Florida on 30 May 1974, was reported in the newspapers and by the Smithsonian Institution (1974). II. Gunter, Hubbs and Beal (1955) gave measurements on a Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia breviceps, which stranded on Mustang Island on the Texas coast and commented upon the recorded variations of proportional measurements in this species. Then according to Raun, Hoese and Moseley (1970) these questions were resolved by Handley (1966), who showed that a second species, Kogia simus, the Dwarf Sperm Whale, is also present in the western North Atlantic. Handley’s argument is based on skull comparisons and it seems to be rather indubitable. According to Raun et al. (op. cit.), the stranding of a species of Kogia on Galveston Island recorded by Caldwell, Ingles and Siebenaler (1960) was K. simus. They also say that Caldwell (in litt.) had previously come to the same conclusion. Caldwell et al. also recorded another specimen from Destin, Florida, which is now considered to have been a specimen of simus.

The growth rate models are necessary for the other parameters of population dynamics of the stocks of this species, whose annual catch, Osborn, Maghan and Drummond (1969), averages 54 million pounds of tail weight, representing 52% of the total shrimp caught in the Gulf of Mexico. This shows that Penaeus aztecus aztecus is the most important of shrimp species exploited in this region. Nevertheless, the brown shrimp is the least well known of the three most common species. The growth rate was determined by fitting the von Bertalanffy growth curve to offshore populations, on which according to Cook and Lindner (1970), there are no published data, although an unsuccessful attempt was made by Klima (1964). Published data are only from inshore waters (Williams 1955, Loesch 1965, Joyce and St. Amant et al., from Cook and Lindner 1970). Statistical calculations of length-weight and total length-tail length ratios were required before available raw data could be used in growth analyses.

Of five white Swiss mice with Sarcoma 180 receiving 0.15 mg Holothurin every other day, one was alive at 57 days and the average weight gain of the group was 10.4 grams in 15 days. White Swiss mice with Sarcoma 180 which survived the lethal effects of slightly higher doses of Holothurin also had prolonged survival times and negligible tumor growth. C57-Bl-6J mice with B-16 melanoma tumors did not show increased survival time using the same doses of Holothurin that were effective in white Swiss mice. Toxicity tests indicated that the safe upper limit for intraperitoneal Holothurin injection in white Swiss mice was 0.10 mg/day, 0.15 mg given every other day, and up to 0.30 mg given in a single injection. Similar tests with C57 black mice showed survival with as much as 0.60 mg Holothurin in a single subcutaneous injection.

Later upon closer examination, she realized that a rubber band encircled the fish, and so she brought the fish to us. The band had deformed the prepelvic isthmus, restricted movement of the pectoral fins, and permanently encircled the fish through a hole in the dorsum. Much of the elasticity was lost, but the band was entire and free to rotate through the perforation below the first dorsal fin. The tissue above the perforation, including the tissue of the dorsal fin, was complete and not severed, although several scales were regenerated.

The present specimen, although badly torn, is clearly recognizable as D. enigmatica. The anastomosing canal lattice has the characteristic pattern described by Russell. The medusa is a deep purpleblue in color and appears to have had a diameter in excess of 70 cm. The mesogloea is 18 mm. thick near the center of the disc. Oral arms are not discernible and portions of the disc are considerably distorted by local extreme contraction. Fragments of female gonadal material are attached to parts of the subumbrellar surface. These gonadal fragments, too small to permit any observations on gross gonad morphology, contain zygotes in various stages of early cleavage. Ova and zygotes are small (c. 100 microns diameter) and have very little, if any, yolk.

There is a significant correlation between the annual production of South Atlantic and Gulf white shrimp, but there is none between South Atlantic and Gulf brown shrimp, possibly because the brown shrimp live generally in deeper water and are not so much influenced by short term variations in climatic conditions as the white shrimp are in shallow water.

The objectives of this experiment were to compare the two methods as marks for shrimp and to obtain information on growth rates and migrations. Eighteen weeks after release, 1,942 (28%) of those marked with the biological stain-internal tag combination and 2,286 (31%) of those marked with Petersen tags had been recovered. The difference in proportions recaptured (significant at P <0.01) could have resulted from greater ease in recognition of the Petersen tag by commercial fishermen or from differential marking mortality, although no evidence was found that differential marking mortality occurred. Marking mortality was observed for both marks and appeared inversely related to size at time of marking. No significant differences were found between growth rates of shrimp marked with the biological stain-internal tag combination and those of shrimp marked with the Petersen tag, although most weekly average increments for stained shrimp were higher. Rates of return were similar in the vicinity of the release area, although a significantly higher proportion (P <0.01) of returns from waters outside of Biloxi Bay were marked with Petersen tags. Again, this was attributed primarily to greater ease in recognition by commercial fishermen. It was concluded that the Petersen tag was the more effective of the two marks as it appeared to be recognized more readily over longer periods of time than the biological stain."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The extensive rhizome development found in Juncus roemerianus makes this species unique among rushes and is a biological feature responsible, in part, for its domination of large tracts of salt marsh. Branching in certain mature plants is distinctly sympodial, while in most it is obscured by precocious development of the continuation bud and appears to be monopodial. Each vegetative unit is composed of a scaly rhizome which grows to varying lengths and then abruptly turns up at the end to become an erect shoot. A continuation rhizome consistently arises from an axillary bud in a ventral scale leaf. Transitional leaves (large scale leaves) accompany development of the erect shoot. Rhizome scales, transitional and foliage leaves are distichously arranged and in the same vertical plane. The culm forms through an elongation of an internode of an erect shoot. Other rhizomes may also arise from buds in the axils of the transitional and foliage leaves. From one to seven terete leaves with a bifacial sheath are produced from the apical meristem of the erect stem. Fibrous roots occur laterally on erect shoots. Non-fibrous roots occur on the ventral surface to the rhizomes. The internal rhizome and root anatomy resembles that reported for most other species of Juncus while the leaf anatomy is very similar to that of Juncus maritimus and Juncus acutus."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Food production along sandy beaches is much different from that of rocky beaches. No large algae grow on sand beaches. Small filamentous green algae find footholds upon molluscs, mole crabs, strands of Leptogorgia and logs. Basic food along the sand beach is made up of diatoms, bacteria, unicellular algae and detritus; diatoms are probably the most abundant autotrophic organism; the beach bacteria are largely heterotrophic. Most food on sandy beaches comes from the sea. The sandy shore seems to be barren, but it swarms with plant and animal life. Food production has a seasonal aspect. Food strands more abundantly on sandy beaches because the force of water returning to the sea is much less than that coming in. Beach materials are concentrated in a strand line. All organic materials are returned to the food cycle. Beached animal remains are consumed immediately until their breakdown products ooze away to enrich the sand substrata. The materialof logs may not be redistributed until a number of years have passed. Food producing algae are diatoms, green algae, peridinians and blue-greens. Many of them are quite small and must be detected by bacteriological methods. They are probably quite significant. Food production from autotrophic algae appears to be relatively steady compared to drifting materials, which may vary enormously. Various types of food drift in as a result of dinoflagellate blooms, catastrophic cold kills and stranding cetaceans. Seasonal drifting materials such as sargassum, Leptogorgia and jellyfish come in at particular times of the year. The river mouth floods bring in material. The artificial jetsam of ships washes up on the beaches. Nutrients and salts are also concentrated on beaches from organic remains. As a result, a type of beach-hugging planktonic bloom has been noted on the Texas coast when the sea is calm following heavy rains. It consists of a yellowish-brown conglomeration of diatoms of the species Chaetoceras sp., 15 to 20 feet wide along the shore for many, many miles. It follows heavy rains and the event is parallel to some aspects of the Florida red tide which occurs in calm weather, often following heavy rains, which are thought to bring chelating substances from the land."

The concentration of POD ranged from 1.50 to 19.79 mg/l, while the PID ranged from 3.20 to 99.61 mg/l. There was a net export of POD during four of 13 tidal periods and a net export of PID during five tidal periods. There was a total net movement of 39.32 and 292.51 kg of POD and PID, respectively, into the marsh. On an annual basis, this is equivalent to the addition of 168 g/m2/yr of detrital material to the marsh. The predictability of POD and PID concentration in the water was good (r2 of 57.9 and 58.1%) during ebb tide based on nine biological and physical variables. The ratio of POD to total suspended material was 15.9% and constant during the year at all concentrations. Although the marsh may not be an important source of carbon for the estuary, data indicate that the marsh may regulate the concentration of suspended detritus in the nearby bay by releasing detritus when the detritus concentration in the water is low and by accumulating detritus when this concentration is high."

On the other hand, living leaves had about the same average silica content (0.93, 0.87, 0.9070 or dry weight). The silica content of living leaves varied from 0.142% in younger leaves to 1.520% in older ones. Similarly, rhizomes also increased in silica content with age, varying from 0.137% in younger portions to 1.030% for older ones. Mature leaves collected in October all had a higher average silica content (0.737%) than those collected in April (0.413%), indicating that silica content also increases over the growing season. Decomposed leaves (dead-standing) had a relatively high silica content o f 1.8170, obviously reflecting a loss of organic matter and soluble minerals. Roots contain considerable silica, but reliable results were not possible as the soil could not be completely removed from them. Petrographic microscope studies showed that the silica was clear, colorless and isotropic with a refractive index of 1.43, all properties typical of the mineral opal. No α-quartz was present, as occurs in some species of Juncus. The silica was deposited in a sheet made up of small, irregular phytoliths arranged in rows lengthwise in the leaves.

Differences in salinity between surface and near-bottom water were calculated from 2,401 pairs of observations made at 90 stations from 4 April 1973 to 12 April 1977. Frequency distribution tables, constructed by tallying the vertical salinity differences into three classes corresponding to three of Pritchard&#039;s estuary types (A, stratified; B, partially mixed; D, well mixed) were used to assess salinity structure of the water column. The greatest variation as to type occurred from January through June. From July through December, the water column becomes predominately uniform. Mississippi Sound is shown to be primarily well mixed with approximately one-third of the observations indicating partially mixed and less than 2% being stratified. The channels are characteristically stratified or partially mixed. The results of this study were in good agreement with the previous classification by another method by the author which confirms that while dominately well mixed, Mississippi Sound also attains the characteristics of a partially mixed estuary and, highly localized, characteristics of a stratified estuary."

Adults of Sagitta friderici and the closely related S. tenuis Conant, 1896 were compared and found to be distinguishable chiefly by (1) the number of ova per unit length of the ovary, and (2) the arrangement of ova within the ovary. The TC values were highly variable and overlapping, thus casting doubt on the taxonomic importance of that characteristic. Sagitta friderici was abundant in inshore continental shelf waters where the salinity and temperature ranged from 24.9 to 33.9 ppt and 23.0 to 30.3°C, respectively.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The Mississippi River drains two thirds of the lower United States plus 13,000 square miles of Canada. When North America was being colonized by Europeans, the river overflowed its banks about once every 3 years and spread onto the floodplain, which today covers 34,600 square miles of the valley. A natural levee formed alongside the river where the silt was dropped when water left the channel; the levee now slopes away from the river at about 7 feet per mile. This high ground was settled first by the white man at New Orleans in 1717. The spring floods barely topped the natural levee and the original town was protected by a ring levee 3 feet high. As more overflow areas were cut off from the river, the levees increased in height to about 40 feet. The hydraulics of the river became better and today more water and silt flows out to sea. About three fourths of the floodplain is closed off from the river, but in 1882 and 1927, the river took that land back, and in 1973 almost 60% of the 22-million-acre area was flooded. Nevertheless, there have been no levee breaks since the Corps of Engineers took over flood control in 1928. The mean flow of the river since 1900 has been 646,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) moment to moment. The mode, median, quartiles and deciles of annual flows are given, and the measurements of dispersion, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation are given. The Atchafalaya River distributary has increased considerably at the expense of the Mississippi River since 1858. During the flood year of 1973, the Atchafalaya carried 37% of the total flow. It is estimated that unless it is brought under control, in about 60 years the Atchafalaya will equal the Mississippi. Flood years are not especially associated and in several cases low flows and flood years are close together. Measurements of river flows before 1900 are unreliable or absent. Since then, however, careful measurements of the daily flows of both distributaries have been taken by the Corps of Engineers and used to compile mean flows in cfs by years. The data extend for a series of 79 years. They were furnished to the author by the New Orleans District of the Corps. These data were used for all calculations given here on flows. The lowest flow recorded for the Atchafalaya was 13,300 cfs" WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0603.09";

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Original work was carried on at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Laboratory on Apalachicola Bay from August 1935 to April 1936. Since then observations have been made in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Five papers on specific aspects of the biology of the animal have been written since on this and other predatory gastropods. Here all commentaries are drawn together and unpublished matter is presented. The name Thais haemastoma is used because separations based upon the rugosity of the shells do not hold up. Perfectly smooth and very rugose specimens are found in the same bays, with various shell characteristics being related to various oyster reefs on which they grow. Radular movement is by the band-over-pulley method suggested by Husley (1853), Herrick (1906) Gunter (1936) and Carriker (1943). Evidence is presented showing that Thais can kill oysters without mechanical injury, presumably by some paralytic material. About one-third of the oysters are opened by large Thais without any boring whatsoever. Smaller Thais are more prone to bore complete holes into the shell cavity of the prey. In Apalachicola Bay large Thais may eat one oyster about every 8 days and it was calculated that on St. Vincent’s Bar 24 million adult oysters could be killed in a year. The resting gonads consist of a thin layer of tissue on the body over the liver and they are lavender-grey in the males and yellowish-orange in the females. They begin to thicken in January and the color intensifies. Egg laying takes place from April to July on the Gulf coast. No young or small Thais were seen in Apalachicola Bay probably because of heavy freshwater drainage in the springs of 1934 and 1935. Several hundred Thais were measured and each month the length frequency mode was at 80.0 mm. The largest known specimen of Thais, a Louisiana specimen, was 103 mm long. A heavy kill of Thais took place in the spring of 1935 and no adults survived in Apalachicola Bay except on Hiles’ Bar near Indian Pass, which is close to the ocean. The Thais seemed to perish when salinity dropped to 9‰ and stayed that way for several weeks. Both oysters and mussels survived at salinities lower than Thais could withstand. Thais shells are extremely hard and are difficult to break with a hammer. Nevertheless, they are cracked by stone crabs. They are also invaded by commensals such as the boring clam" WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0603.05";

In addition to crustaceans, fishes followed by polychaetes occurred as the most important items (in 99, 43, and 15% of the drum with food, respectively). Blue crabs occurred in even more drum than the frequently encountered penaeid shrimps. Other commercial species were negligible in the diet.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Recent papers by Eskinazi, compared to studies made on the Texas and Louisiana coasts 35 to 45 years ago and on the south Atlantic coast 15 years ago, show remarkable similarities of the estuarine fishes of northeastern Brazil and the northern Gulf of Mexico. Forty-five of 48 families of the two areas are in common and about 35% of the species are in common. On the west coast even greater correspondence might be expected between fishes of Peru and southern California, were it not for the restriction of tropical fishes by the Humboldt and California currents. When the lithospheric plate under North America pulled away from Pangaea, strong swimmers and pelagic fishes maintained connections. Thus, the marine fishes have had strong connections for the last 70 million years. Further, the Pacific and Atlantic faunas were connected until the mid-Pliocene when Isthmus America became continuous about 5.7 million years ago. Marine euryhaline fishes are much more abundant than their freshwater counterparts. Thus large numbers of marine fishes are found in the fresh waters of Panama. One hundred thirty-seven (137) marine fishes have been found there and 57 species have taken up more or less permanent residence. No freshwater fish have taken up residence in the seas of Panama. The freshwater fishes of Central America came from the south and their movement has been very slow. Isthmus America was a ridged mountainous area with short, small rivers and small basins. The estuaries were small or nonexistent. Thus, one avenue for spread of fishes from fresh water was generally nonexistent. There are 32 river basins in Panama and fish have little access from one to the other. So the river basins have an insular aspect. The Canal runs through only three river basins. There are generally no problems to the passage of freshwater fishes in the Canal but they are stopped by even low salinity and, if back pumping becomes necessary to maintain the lakes used in the operation of the locks, most freshwater fishes will not traverse the Canal. Thus, it may be said that there is little chance of transfer of freshwater fishes from one coast to the other. However, the tarpon has already crossed the isthmus and eight other species, including blennies, gobies and pipefishes, have made the passage according to ichthyological collectors. Actually only four fishes are indubitable crossers. Back pumping will increase the potentiality a great deal but" WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0603.07";

This approach to analysis of catch statistics can be used to monitor these fisheries, and the results can be compared with changes that may be brought about by the closure of the fishery conservation zone off Texas, as proposed by 1981 by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, in the fishery management plan for the shrimp fishery of the Gulf of Mexico."

In order of their importance, primary components grouped in major taxonomic categories were fishes, penaeid shrimps, and other crustaceans for Cynoscion nebulosus; Crustaceans and fishes for C. arenarius; fishes and crustaceans for C. nothus; crustaceans, pelecypods, and polychaetes for Pogonias cromis; crustaceans, molluscs, polychaetes, and fishes for Archosargus probatocephalus; and fishes and penaeid shrimps for Paralichthys lethostigma. Principal items in the diets of most of the fishes included Anchoa mitchilli, Penaeus aztecus, P. setiferus, and Callinectes sapidus. Those crustaceans show that competition exists for commercial shellfishes in Mississippi Sound. Ratios among the different dietary items vary, according at least to species of fish, length of fish, season, specific location, and abundance of available prey. Some of these variations are documented and are additionally related to selected findings by other authors sampling different localities. We suggest that examination of food items in Archosargus probatocephalus can serve as a practical means to sample and assess seasonal prevalence and abundance of a wide range of invertebrates throughout different habitats in Mississippi Sound and elsewhere."

Shoot longevity varied between populations, with some shoots producing one leaf and living 4 months, while others produced seven leaves and lived over 4 years. An equation was developed from plastochron and leaf-age determinations to estimate shoot age in each population studied. Major morphological events common to all populations were (1) cessation of growth of the first leaf produced on an erect stem when growth of the second leaf was initiated, and (2) death of the leaf from the tip downward. Although the time period was variable, growth rates of leaves equalled their death rates in each population during maximum periods of growth and subsequent decline. While growth and death rates were similar between two of the populations (M, T) investigated, these rates were vastly different from those representative of the third population (S). Growth and death kinetics for leaves on individual shoots involved cyclic phenomena represented by a series of greatly overlapping harmonic curves. Each shoot reached a maximum carrying capacity expressed as linear biomass. Although living portions were often distributed over three or four leaves, the total equated to two mature living leaves for the medium (M) and tall-leaved (T) populations. In the short-leaved population (S) , the maximum amount of biomass attained by a single shoot during its life span equalled that of one mature leaf. A peculiar steady-state or homeostasis in growth and net productivity exists in each population. Short-lived shoots in the short-leaved population (S) was shown to have a rapid turnover of replacement rate, which is responsible for a high net productivity equal to or exceeding the net productivity of both the medium and tall-leaved populations. Although the cause of variation in basic growth pattems between the three populations was not investigated, both genetic and environmental factors may be involved." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0701.04";

On the Pass Marianne Reef, 71% of the live oysters and 44% of the dead shells were infested with D. smithii. The mean number of clams removed from valves of live oysters was 22.1 ± 1.7 (range, 1-109; N = 146). Infested dead shells had a mean number of 23.7 ± 2.6 (range, 1-103; N = 75) clams per shell. Clams from live and dead shells indicated monthly variations in morphological stages. During January through April, clams were predominantly immature. In late spring and early summer, clams matured morphologically. In May and June, the majority of clams were mature. Immature clams from early and midsummer spawnings appeared in July and August. Mean lengths and heights of clams with and without a callum and the monthly changes in those dimensions were determined for clams from live and dead shells.

The average time of tidal inundation at a particular elevation was less during winter than spring.

A west to east gradient of increasing salinity and salinity stratification was evident. Faunal differences among stations were assessed using indices of diversity, biological dominance, pollution, and station homogeneity. The fauna of the marina stations had a low species diversity and was dominated by annelids, indicative of a stressed environment. The fauna of stations near the I.H.N.C. were similar to the marina stations. Moving westward from the I.H.N.C., species diversity increased and the fauna became dominated by mollusks. Stressful conditions associated with the intrusion of water from the I.H.N.C. into Lake Pontchartrain appeared to be responsible for the faunal differences observed."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The first few launches of the space shuttle resulted in fish kills in a lagoon near the launch site. To study this phenomenon further, sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were exposed to the exhaust plume in buckets placed near the launch site. An open bucket provided a full exposure, a partly closed one provided an intermediate exposure, and a closed one was the control. Three h after launch, the pH of the water from the full exposure had decreased from about 7 to about 3, Al and Fe levels had increased, and some fish had died. Gills ol most fishes from full exposures and some from intermediate exposures were damaged. Gills, however, exhibited no aneurysms, mucus coagulation, or hemorrhaging. Some secondary lamellae swelled, some fused with adjacent lamellae, and others clubbed or retracted into the filament. Many lamellar pavement cells died and sloughed off. Mucous cells of intermediate exposure specimens bulged on the filament surface and pavement cells lost their microridges. Mineral deposits, probably aluminum oxide, occurred on gills of fishes from full exposures. Focally, pavement cells were eroded exposing the underlying structures. The sudden pH drop in the full exposures probably caused the gill damage. However, we could not determine the effect of previous exposure on the experimental fish, or whether gill damage was the lethal lesion. The possibility is indicated that some fish recover after exposure to the exhaust plume." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0704.01";

Plants grown in complete nutrient solutions, with various sources of Fe, were very robust. Growth was better with FeCl3 than with FeEDTA. The most robust growth occurred in plants grown in the nutrient medium deficient in micronutrients (B, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo), indicating that J. roemerianus is very sensitive to specific or certain combined micronutrients or concentrations generally recommended for terrestrial, especially agricultural, plants. The qualitative and quantitative symptoms, such as color, length, and abundance of leaves and roots as a response to deficiency of specific elements, were similar to those deficiency symptoms previously described for numerous terrestrial plants.

Data on the food from the stomachs of 183 rails were analyzed and the earlier literature critically reviewed. During the warmer months (May through early fall), crabs, predominantly Uca spp., comprised the major part of the food items found. Limited data on a few rails collected during late fall and winter, when Uca spp. are not usually available, indicate that snails then become a major part of the clapper rail’s diet during that part of the year. Earlier studies, which describe the food or feeding habits of clapper rails, are reviewed and the food habits and trophic relationships of some other tidal marsh consumers are discussed. Data from this and previous studies indicate that clapper rails are opportunistic omnivores, and occupy a relatively broad niche within tidal marsh ecosystems. A comparison of available data of the food of five clapper rail subspecies of the eastern United States indicates no distinct differences in their feeding behavior. Differences in the kinds of food eaten appear to simply reflect the types of marsh habitat (fresh, brackish, polyhaline) or geographical location (temperate, subtropical, tropical) in which a particular clapper rail population occurs. The food habits of the king rail are compared with those of the clapper rail and problems concerning the taxonomic status of the “subspecies” of Rallus longirostris are briefly discussed."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Several hundred specimens of the red drum from Mississippi were critically assessed. Regression equations for standard-length (SL) versus total-length differed between males and females and between small and large members of the same sex. A single regression line represented the weight-SL relationship for males with females. For condition coefficients to be helpful, fish had to be grouped at least by sex, season, and length or stage of maturity. By 12 months of age, most fish were about 30 to 32 cm SL and their distribution ranged throughout Mississippi Sound rather than being restricted to inshore bayou and marsh habitats like younger individuals. Juvenile fish tended to have a high hepatosomatic index (HSI) in winter, and adults had a low one following spawning. The gonosomatic index (GSI) was typically lower than the HSI except for gravid fish in spring and summer. The number of oocytes available for spawning appeared to be much higher than cited in previous reports. The highest calculated fecundity, occurring in a 758 mm SL fish, was 62 million using a volumetric displacement method and 95 million using a gravimetric one. Extrapolated estimates for larger fish were much higher. Resting and yolk-vesicle stage oocytes typically had an irregular shape, an eccentrically located nucleus, and an abundance of highly basophilic substance in the ooplasm. Throughout a seasonal histological examination, both gonads contained, often in an abundance, Periodic-acid-Schiff-positive granular leukocytes. Spawning took place in late September and October one year, but apparently has occurred over longer periods when conditions of temperature and photoperiod were appropriate. No tagged, 1-year-old fish were returned from farther than 33 km from the point of release. Adults, however, apparently migrated extensively, especially from October through April. Those adults tagged several km south of the barrier islands included individuals caught 778 km away in Texas after 746 days and 316 km away in Florida after 399 days. Another fish apparently migrated at least 120 km in inshore waters in 6 days or fewer. An estimated 25 million kg or more of red drum occurred at one time between the Mississippi River and Mobile Point, Alabama.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="About 3,000 specimens of the spotted seatrout from Mississippi Sound and adjacent water grouped by males and females had a nearly identical standard length (SL) versus total length (TL) relationship, although the equation for males in winter differed from that for those in other seasons. When investigating the SL-weight relationship, some differences occurred both among seasons and between sexes. Therefore, condition coefficients (K) were calculated to compare male and female groups according to their length and state of maturation on a seasonal basis. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) tended to increase with fish length, with relatively high values occurring in winter compared to low ones in summer when livers exhibited an abundance of lipid. Seasonal values of gonosomatic index (GSI) were typically less than those for HSI, except for ripe or nearly ripe fish. Males and females often concurrently exhibited contrasting values for both HSI and GSI. Females matured as short as 189 mm SL and males by 201 mm, and the percentage of gravid females in summer increased with increasing SL. By the time fish reached 40 cm, females constituted 85.7% of the sample from Mississippi Sound, not counting additional samples in 1982 that contained more males between 350 and 475 mm than females. Ovaries contained more oocytes than indicated in the literature. The largest estimate of oocytes over 30 μm in diameter per female was ten and one-half million using a simple volumetric displacement method, or fifteen and one-half million when calculated using a gravimetric technique. Based on histological and other evidence, most individual fish in Mississippi apparently spawned periodically from April to September and even longer during years with appropriate temperature conditions. When gravid, fish tended to group in schools composed primarily of males or females. Tagging studies indicated that neither C. nebulosus nor C. arenarius moved farther than 25 km from their location of release. Both seatrouts hosted parasites that harm the host in natural water and culture conditions, that adversely affect their respective fisheries, and that potentially cause human distress.

Rodlet cells in control fish occurred in all parts of the nephron except the renal corpuscle, were oblong to pear-shaped (about 5x10 µm), and contained up to 30 rodlet bodies, a basally situated nucleus, poorly developed mitochondria, and a filamentous cortex. Desmosomes and tight junctions joined rodlet cells to kidney epithelial cells. After cadmium exposure, rodlet cells showed a range of responses from secretory stimulation to necrosis. Rodlet bodies, which were membrane-bound, club-shaped granules, were secreted by a merocrine process, apparently aided by contraction of the fllamentous cortex. New rodlet bodies were assembled in the Golgi apparatus. Mitochondria hypertrophied and developed well-defined cristae. The ultrastructural organization of the rodlet cells in this study and their responses to stimuli suggest that these are tissue or host cells rather than parasites as proposed by some authors. Further studies, however, are needed to confirm the nature of these cells." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0704.08";

Exponents of the models were used as indices to investigate trends in ex-vessel value per shrimp, in size composition, and in ex-vessel value composition of the annual catches during that period. Both the spread in ex-vessel value per shrimp among size categories and the size of shrimp in the annual catches increased from 1960 to 1978. Also, the proportion of the ex-vessel value made up of shrimp of larger sizes increased from 1960 to 1978. This approach to analysis of catch statistics can be used to monitor the fishery, and the results can be compared with changes that may be brought about by permanently closing the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary in 1981, as proposed by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council in the fishery management plan for the shrimp fishery of the Gulf of Mexico."

Two of the four known genera (Histiobranchus and Diastobranchus) have not been reported from the Gulf. Synaphobranchidae tend to occur within a narrow range of temperatures compared to the North Atlantic synaphobranchid eels. However, distribution of these eels in the deeper parts of the Gulf appears to be correlated more to change in depth than to temperature, salinity, or dissolved oxygen. The distribution at the shallower limits of their depth range appear to be a result of synergistic effects of the dissolved oxygen demand and the change in temperature. The synaphobranchid eels&#039; apparent preferences for particular types of substrata are probably associated with the organisms preyed on rather than direct selection of bottom type by the eels. These eels are opportunistic feeders, feeding primarily on fish, squid, and crustaceans.

Snails longer than 5 mm in length increase in average size with decreasing elevation. This distribution is opposite to that found by Hamilton (1978) in a marsh in Florida. No difference was found in our study area in growth rate of marked snails at two different elevations, so the size-elevation gradient probably is not caused by differences in growth rate. Snails 15 to 19 mm long are more active when exposed to reduced salinities than snails > 21 mm long. The lowest salinities recorded in the marsh occurred at the highest elevations.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Juncus roemerianus generally occupies the upper half of the intertidal plane and covers about 92% or 25,000 hectares of marsh in Mississippi. The vegetative canopy is best described as a series of disjunct and intergrading populations. Considerable phenotypic variation and differences in standing crop exist between populations. J. roemerianus has very wide environmental tolerances in comparison to all other tidal marsh angiosperms. Soil types inhabited by the rush range from very sandy to highly organic muds and peats, which may vary in the concentration of nutrient elements (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). Neither soil type, nutrient concentration, water content, pH nor elevation can be used to distinguish the habitat of J. roemerianus, because similar conditions are found in areas occupied by pure or almost pure monotypic stands of other plant species. Soil water salinity is cyclic in all populations of J. roemerianus examined and salinity appears to be the major edaphic factor affecting growth and distribution of the rush. The greatest concentration and fluctuation of salt content occurs in the near-surface soil layer and the lowest concentration of salt and most stable soil water regime occurs at increasingly lower depths. Experimental evidence indicates that the rush grows best in fresh water, without competition, and cannot tolerate continuous salinities greater than 30 ppt. Soil organisms which detrimentally affect the rhizomes are major factors limiting distribution of the rush into freshwater areas. Salt concentrations in the soil solution of 35-360 ppt occurs frequently in some near-surface marsh soil layers. J. roemerianus growing on \"salt flats\" apparently survives near-surface hypersaline soil water (90-360 ppt) because of deeply penetrating, specialized roots. About five billion seeds of J. roemerianus are produced annually in Mississippi tidal marshes, but few rush seedlings are found. Germination requires light, and seedling establishment is the vulnerable stage in the life cycle of the species. Vigorous mature stands are maintained by rhizome growth and the frequent removal of dead-standing leaves by physical factors such as storms, heavy rains, tides, and currents."

Ninety-five percent of the spot were collected in the island and sound areas, where the salinity was higher than in the bayous. Catch per unit effort was high at island and sound stations in spring and autumn, with relatively few fish caught during the winter spawning season and summer. The relatively high frequency of spot observed at the island stations in the autumn was probably influenced by spawning migrations, and the high spring values may repesent a combination of two abundant year classes. The two greatest yearly collections, in 1983 and 1986, may have been influenced by sampling conditions or by environmental conditions favorable to survival either during those years or earlier when those fish were postlarvae.

Of the five currently recognized species of Pseudosphyrapus Cup, 1980, P. siegi is most closely related to P. dispar (Lang, 1968), a southwestem Pacific cognate and only other member of the genus having a squama on antenna 2. Pseudosphyrapus siegi is distinguished from P. dispar by: (1) a more triangular, but less acute, rostrum (2) the presence of two 4-pronged spines on the second maxilla (homologous spines on P. dispar are 3-pronged), and (3) the absence of a spiniform process on the chelipedal carpus. Other less noticeable differences between the two species occur in the setation or spination of the maxilliped and pereopods. Except for a small genital cone on males and developing oostegites on females, no noticeable sexual dimorphism (e.g., setation of antenna 1, enlargement or modification of chela and pereopod 1 in males) was exhibited by the specimens of P. siegi examined. It is probable, however, that more fully developed and sexually dimorphic males exist for P. siegi. The limited collection data suggests that body size in P. siegi may increase with depth.

Both of these species are assigned to the poorly known genus Mesotanais Dollfus, 1897. Mesotanais is unique within the Leptocheliidae because its members lack eyes. The second supposedly important generic character, uniramous uropods, reported in the original description is considered to be a misdiagnosis. The assumption of this error is supported by the rediscovery of the type-species, Mesotanais dubius Dollfus, 1897 (Sieg and Bird, in press). In the present study, the genus Mesotanais is rediagnosed and the two new species from the western Atlantic are described. Mesotanais longisetosus n. sp. can be distinguished from M. vadicola n. sp. by a variety of characters including the much longer terminal setae on antenna 1, the distinctly more elongate carpus of the cheliped, and the shape of the pars molaris of the mandible. Mesotanais longisetosus appears to be closely related to the type-species, M. dubius known from the eastern Atlantic. It is distinguished from M. dubius by having an elongate distal seta on the carpus and more styliform dactylus of the first peraeopod, and by the presence of two short, distal, tergal spines on the merus of peraeopods 4-6. Mesotanais vadicola occurred at depths of 22-865 m, while M. longisetosus was collected mainly from the upper continental slope at depths of 545-1386 m. Between 500 m and 900 m there is a broad area of overlap in the distribution of the two species, but with increasing depth M. vadicola is replaced by M. longisetosus."

Recovery of spat planted on adjacent bay bottom was negligible, despite the use of either whole oyster valves, crushed oyster shell or clam shell as a substrate. Negligible growth occurred for spat held in vertical and horizontal water tanks. Growth of spat in horizontal tanks was affected by the density of stocking, with lower densities producing faster growth. Growth in all studies was slower than anticipated and a comparison on growth for spat from a Maryland hatchery with locally-produced spat suggests that the low growth was related to the local waters. Overall, growth as determined by increase in greatest shell dimensions of spat is as follows: on-bottom, 2.90 mm/mo; raft culture., 1.78 mm/mo; upwelling tank, 1.19 mm/mo; and horizontal trough, 2.0 mm/mo."

Most of these events are not known to affect the shelf populations directly, but indirect effects through food chain disruptions are likely. Loop Current intrusions and entrainment of deep Gulf waters could directly impact the shelf species. Imposed upon these events are various human intrusions which have severely reduced the quality and quantity of inshore habitats. Increase in commercial and recreational fishing pressure in the inside waters and on the continental shelf during the past two decades has been accompanied by dramatic decline in populations of demersal and pelagic fish species.

Equal numbers of eggs were randomly assigned to one of six treatments of weathered crude oil (control, 50, 100, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/l) and observed through the yolk-sac stage. There were no differences in mean survival, length of surviving larvae, and frequency of morphological abnormalities among treatments (α < 0.05). In addition, the frequency of spinal deformity and abnormal mouth development was low in all treatments. The initial chemical composition of the fresh crude oil and the seasonally warm weather contributed to the natural degradation of the soluble toxic components." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0801.03";

At the neritic station, temperature was lower, salinity was higher, and variations in the two parameters smaller as compared to the two lagoon stations. Zooplankton abundance ranged from 3585.5 org./m3 at the neritic station to 18,742.7 org./m3 at Cuenca Norte. Considering all animals collected, decapod larvae (39%), copepods (28.7%) and ophiopluteus-echinopluteus larvae (22.8%) made the bulk of the catch. A total of 47 copepod species were recorded, of these, 14 were found at Bojórquez, 12 at Cuenca Norte and 42 at the neritic station. Acartia tonsa dominated the copepod population assemblage at Bojórquez (94.4%) and made important contributions at Cuenca Norte (34.5%) and in the neritic station (24.5%). Paracalanus quasimodo was most abundant at Cuenca Norte (40.3%) and contributed 20.9% at the neritic station. It is suggested that both, the high capture of A. tonsa in Bojórquez and the dominance of P. quasimodo at Cuenca Norte, is probably related with two factors: the anthropogenically nutrient-enriched condition of Bojórquez lagoon and the relatively higher breeding frequency of the chaetognath Sagitta hispida in Bojórquez. The highest abundance of zooplankters occurred at the stations within the lagoonal system, and the highest number of copepod species was found at the neritic station, where more stable conditions prevailed."

UPDATE publications SET abstract="An index of biological sensitivity to changes in freshwater inflow was developed for 44 species in 22 Gulf of Mexico estuaries for adult and juvenile life stages of fishes and macroinvertebrates. The BioSalinity Index (BSI) provides an innovative approach to quantify estuary-specific sensitivity of organisms to changes in estuarine salinity regimes based upon our knowledge of species salinity habitat preferences, the availability of this preferred habitat, and the relative abundance and distribution of species in time and space. We found that a significant difference exists between adult and juvenile life stage sensitivity, with juveniles exhibiting a lower sensitivity to salinity changes than adults, and that a considerable disparity exists in species-specific sensitivities among Gulf estuaries. Likewise, when the full complement of 44 species-level BSIs are averaged, marked differences in assemblage-wide sensitivity are evident across estuaries. The availability of preferred salinity habitat had a greater influence on the BSI for estuarine species than did their relative abundance and temporal distribution. The BSI was applied by members of a 1995 Gulf of Mexico freshwater inflow workshop to identify a subset of estuaries which appear more sensitive to freshwater inflow changes and are candidates for further study."

Differences between samples from fringe and mid-bed for several constituents were significant and, if not accounted for, could affect the measurement of apparent seasonal cycles. Fringe-shoots, reflecting the influence of more intense grazing activity, had shorter leaf blade lengths, lower dry weights and carbohydrate levels, and higher protein levels than mid-bed shoots. Mid-bed rhizomes and roots had highest protein and ash levels reflecting possible sediment influence. Percent ash and protein in the rhizomes, and percent carbohydrate in the roots exhibited seasonal fluctuations, but the levels were different between fringe and mid-bed samples. Protein levels were greatest in shoots and roots, while carbohydrate levels were highest in rhizomes, illustrating the respective partitioning of biosynthetic and storage functions. The spatial differences seem to reflect gradients in biological and chemical interactions, and they may play an important role in trophic interactions in seagrass systems."

Regression of the available data on Secchi disk transparency versus time (1953 through 1990) reveals a statistically significant decrease in transparency of about 40%. However, the data set is biased in that it does not adequately represent the seasonal effects of salinity and wind speed. Two analytical procedures were undertaken to determine the extent to which the apparent long-term decrease in transparency was dependent on the seasonal bias. One procedure involved seasonal adjustment of the data for the effects of salinity and wind speed. The other procedure was to remove the seasonal bias by constructing unbiased data sets. Seasonal adjustment for the effects of salinity and wind speed reduced the level of significance for the relationship between Secchi disk transparency and time from about 1% to about 10%. This result indicates that some of the apparent decrease in transparency in the original data is the result of inadequate representation of seasonal effects in the biased data set. In most years data are not available for all months with the result that the seasonal effects of salinity and wind speed are not adequately represented. When the bias was removed by constructing unbiased data sets, the data no longer supported the conclusion of a statistically significant change in Secchi disk transparency from 1953 to 1990; p > 0.5."

Specimens were collected off southeast Louisiana to northwest Florida by hook-and-line during February through October 1987-1991. Fork lengths (FL) of these fish ranged from 580-1,530 mm, with corresponding weights of 2.0-43.5 kg. The female:male ratio was 1:0.37. Using a combination of oocyte size frequency and histological assessment of many of the fish, we determined that females were ripe from May through September, with atretic oocytes occurring in some fish from July through October. Degenerating hydrated oocytes in July and October and the presence of resting ovaries in July suggest two major spawning periods; however, monthly gonosomatic indices peaking in May, followed by a steady decline, do not support that finding. Ovaries were placed into undeveloped, early developing, mid-developing , or late developing categories based upon oocyte size-frequency distributions. Developing ovaries had two or three modes of oocytes larger than 30 pm. Batch fecundity was estimated to be 2.6x106 to 1.91x108 oocytes, depending on the size of fish/ovaries. The smallest female with oocytes exhibiting vitellogenesis was 834 mm FL. This fish was 2 years old based its otolith evaluation. The smallest male with an abundance of spermatozoa in its testes was 640 mm FL and 1 year old based on otolith evaluation; smaller males were not examined. Females larger than 840 mm FL had vitellogenic oocytes in March and April. A few fish still had vitellogenic oocytes in early October, but none did by late October. When Gilson’s fluid was used to assess ovarian tissue, the fresh weight of the tissue was reduced by 20% after being stored for 3 months. The diameter of oocytes shrunk about 25% in Gilson’s fluid which was 11% less than those fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.

Gonadal indices increased to late active stages by March, with ripe individuals present in April. Spawning commenced in May and continued into June. Sex ratio (0.48 female to 1.00 male) was significantly unequal. Results of this study indicate that clams achieved sexual maturity and spawned when cultured in the coastal waters of Georgia.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Levinseniella (Austromicrophallus) deblocki, n. sp., was collected during parasitologic studies of homeothermic vertebrates from salt marshes along the coast of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Because L. deblocki lacks a femal epouch, it belongs to the subgenus Monarrhenos proposed by Deblock and Pearson (1970). However, since Deblock and Pearson did not explicitly designate a type species for Monarrhenos, it is not available and is a nomen nudum. The next available name, Austormicrophallus Szidat, 1964, a genus synonymized with Levinseniella Stiles and Hassall, 1901 by Deblock (1978), is reinstated as a subgenus to receive the species lacking a female pouch and previously assigned to Monarrhenos. The adult of L. deblocki is found in the lower digestive tracts of the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Morphologically, L. deblocki appears to be most similar to L. polydactyla Deblock and Rose, 1962, known from Europe, and L. ophidea (Nicol, Dameree, and Wootton, 1985), described from a freshwater habitat in California. Differences in the life cycle, habitat type, and geographic distribution, plus a combination of distinctive morphological characters (presence of lappets on the oral sucker, number of genital pockets, and body size) separate L. deblocki from the other members of the subgenus Austromicrophallus. The metacercarial stage of L. deblocki occurs in the gonads of fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) and the fist intermediate host appears to be a hydrobud gastropod (Heleobops sp.). Observations on living and preserved specimens fixed in copula indicate that the genital atrium functions as an eversible hermaphroditic organ bearing the male papillae and metraterm. The genital hooks or “Jägersköld’s bodies” appear to function as holdfast structures during copulation." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0902.03";

Crustaceans, consisting primarily of portunid crabs, were the predominant food. Crustaceans occurred in 79.1% of the stomachs and comprised 77.6% of the total number of identifiable prey. The second most important prey category was fish which was dominated by hardhead catfish, Arius felis, and eels. Fish occurred in 58.5% of the stomachs but only accounted for 20.3% of the total number of prey. The importance of fish as prey increased with increasing size (length) of cobia, with the largest size class of cobia (1,150-1,530 mm FL) showing the highest percent frequency occurrence of fish prey (84.4%). There were no significant differences between the diets of male and female cobia. Species composition of the diet indicated that cobia examined in this study were generalist carnivores in their feeding habits and fed primarily on benthic/epibenthic crustaceans and fishes. However, the occurrence of pelagic prey provided evidence of diversity in the foraging behavior of cobia.

These observation towers allowed activities of the two species to be compared throughout the nonbreeding season. Although BWT and GWT often fed together, time spent in various activities differed. Feeding was the most frequent activity of both BWT(64.5%) and GWT (55.3%), but BWT spent more time feeding (P < 0.01) and alert (P < 0.05), but spent less (P < 0.01) time resting than GWT. Within each species there were differences in activity budgets among daily time blocks and among months, but few differences among the three habitats studied. Temperature and light intensity were correlated with resting (+), feeding (-), locomotion (-), and preening (+). Daily and monthly activity budgets of BWT and GWT were similar, as were ingested foods, suggesting that these two species used the study areas primarily for foraging, and left the areas for other activities.

Fatty acids in the striped mullet provided a greater number of statistically similar groups than those in spot, indicating greater variability among individual striped mullet, which probably reflected a greater diversity in the feeding regime for this species.

As part of a larger study on artificial breeding of sciaenid fishes, we developed procedures for collection, handling, refrigerated storage, and cryopreservation of spotted seatrout sperm. Hanks&#039; balanced salt solution (HBSS) was used as an extender for collection and storage of sperm. Sperm motility in relation to graded concentrations of HBSS was used to determine the osmolality at which sperm were activated. Based on these findings, HBSS was prepared at 201 mOsm/kg as an extender for sperm storage. To determine if ions present in HBSS were involved in sperm activation, separate activating solutions were prepared by the addition of NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, Na2HPO4, or MgSO4 to aliquots of a stock glucose solution (185 mOsm/kg). The chemicals were added at the concentration of each found in 1-x HBSS. Only the glucose solution containing 8 g/l NaCl(424 mOsm/kg) produced activation of sperm. We also evaluated four chemicals as cyroprotectants: methanol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and n,n-dimethyl acetamide. Two freezing rates were evaluated by placing samples at either of two heights within a nitrogen vapor shipping dewar. The highest post-thaw motilities were in 10% DMSO with an average retention of 60% of initial motility at the lower position in the dewar, and 37% at the upper position. A third freezing rate was produced using a computer-controlled freezer programmed for a rate of -45ºC/min, yielding a retention of initial motility of 31%. Our freezing and transport of cryopreserved sperm in shipping dewars demonstrate the utility of this procedure for field applications." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0903.05";

Salinity varied seasonally and spatially and was primarily related to variations in rainfall during this study. Reduced rainfall after October 1985 resulted in the upstream movement of saline water and a concommitant shift in benthic crustaceans upstream with this change in the physical-chemical environment.

These investigations began three months before brine discharge was initiated in 1981. A preliminary summary by Giammona and Darnell (1990) relied on just three years of discharge data and gave misleading reports of brine impacts. Brine effects over the nine years of study were minimal, in part because the fine sediments of the study area were numerically dominated by opportunistic species. mostly estuarine taxa, that showed dramatic population fluctuations both spatially and temporally. These fluctuations in benthic densities were the most salient characteristic of the study area. They resulted from summer hypoxia and anoxia in bottom waters, not from brine. The hypoxia was related to Mississippi River discharge and subsequent salinity stratification. Hypoxia eliminated some taxa and severely reduced populations of most benthic species. The only significant differences between communities near the diffuser and those outside the influence of its discharged brine resulted from water-column mixing by the discharged brine, which oxygenated waters around the diffuser and stabilized the salinity of bottom water at the stations near the diffuser. This enhanced benthic diversity around the diffuser and resulted in greater populations during some seasons." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0901.06";

Day and night collections were conducted in backwaters, lake shores, and lake centers by seining and trawling. Bay anchovies were the second most abundant fish species collected, and exhibited seasonal, diet and habitat variations in abundance and distribution. Across the study area, seasonal abundance peaks occurred in May and August following migration into the marsh and seasonal recruitment. However, within each habitat type, peaks of abundance varied in time of occurrence. Within habitats, significant differences in the mean number of anchovies occurred such that backwaters in the daytime had the greatest number followed by backwaters at night, lake shores in the daytime, and lake shores at night. Lake center collections showed no significant diel pattern. The presence of vegetation was associated with reduced anchovy numbers; however, when present, anchovies were significantly more abundant in the daytime than at night."

Observations on Georgia estuarine habitats where extant populations of softshell clams occurred are described. On several occasions, fresh shells with periostracum and tissue remnants were found in a brackish drainage system on Sapelo Island. These shells represent the first southern records of extant populations of softshell clams from such a specialized habitat type. Living specimens of M. arenaria from the benthos and specimens in the stomach contents of stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) were collected at four stations during 1969 in the North and South Newport Rivers. mesohaline tidal systems forming part of the southern and northern headwaters of St. Catherines and Sapelo Sounds.The stomach of a stingray collected near the mouth of Little Ogeeche River during another study also contained specimens of M. arenaria. Ephemeral, intertidal, winter populations of juvenile softshell clams are reported from exposed Pleistocene beach faces along tidal rivers in Chatham, Georgia. The associated fauna collected with softshell clams and occurrence of other cold temperate and boreal species from Georgia estuaries are discussed. The distribution of M. arenaria appears to be mainly limited by a critical maximum temperature of 28º. The relatively cooler summer temperatures observed at the Sapelo Island tidal ditch site may enable the species to survive in this restricted habitat. Data from the present study indicate that during winter and spring, softshell clams appear to be bionomically important components of the benthos and the diet of stingrays in some Georgia estuarine habitats. Whether or not reproducing populations of M. arenaria occur year-round in Georgia estuaries still remains an open question." WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0902.02";

This species has been used extensively in aquatic environmental toxicity and carcinogenicity tests (Couch et al., 1981; Courtney and Couch, 1984). Hepatic neoplasms have been induced in the sheepshead minnow by exposure to several known chemical carcinogens including diethylnitrosamine (Couch and Courtney, 1987), methylazoxymethanolacetate (Hawkins etal., 1985), and dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (Hawkins et al., 1991). Because of its widespread distribution, limited home range, and proven sensitivity tocarcinogens, the sheepshead minnow appears to be a good candidate to serve as an in situ monitor of environmental carcinogens and other toxicants in coastal waters, especially those of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. To establish background information on the histopathological lesions in sheepshead minnows taken from the wild, we collected and examined specimens from an offshore site presumed to be free of chemical contamination.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="The study of marine life of the Gulf of Mexico has progressed slowly as compared to other regions of the United States. Much of this lack of progress is probably due to the absence of universities in the coastal area, and the absence of large populated centers where marine research would be encouraged. The early work was done by travelers and expeditions from places remote to the Gulf. Only in the present century has there been any attempt to establish marine laboratories on this seaside. Most of these laboratories have been located in rather remote, inaccessible places, and have usually suffered from inattention by the parent institution. In recent years, however, the search for oil, industrial growth of coastal cities, and the development of beach resorts have brought new roads and more people to the coast. During the same time the Gulf fishing industry expanded enormously, and, in value, became the largest fishery of the several important fishing regions of the United States. For instance, according to Fisheries Industries of the United States for 1956, the Gulf coast produced more in pounds and value than the Pacific coast, and more in value than the New England states. This new growth has stimulated a demand for more scientific knowledge of the Gulf and its waters. The scientific study of the Mollusca of the Gulf of Mexico has been carried on in the past in museums far from this region. The bulk of this work has dealt mainly with taxonomy, and even the geographical distribution of most species is poorly known. The writer’s purpose in the present work is to give a brief history of prior work on Mollusca along the Mississippi coast, to identify the species found in the area studied, and to discuss what is known of the distribution, abundance, and habits of many of the species. The work was done at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and was carried on concurrently while the writer was engaged in other duties and activities. Most of the specimens were collected near the Laboratory or around Horn and Ship Islands, but both ends of Mississippi Sound received attention, and it is believed that the collections are representative of the entire area. The writer did not attempt to work in fresh water, and limited the marine collections to the area inside a line drawn one mile south of the barrier" WHERE doi="10.18785/grr.0101.01";

Unfortunately I cannot agree with Doctor Gunter’s views on the scientific names that should be used for the two Atlantic species of White Shrimp. In the first place I believe that Doctor Gunter’s suggestion that the northern species should be known at Penaeus fluviatilis Say and the southern as P. setiferus (L.) instead of respectively P. setiferus (L.) and P. schmitti Burkenroad, is not in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Army on Horn Island, Mississippi, and decided to observe and record the animals and plants existing there. At the time, it seemed that little attention had been devoted to the wildlife of this island, but eventually it became apparent that some studies had been made. However, many of the observations have not been published and many of the records of the flora and fauna living on and around the island are scattered and unavailable. The most outstanding papers include those of Lloyd and Tracy (1901), Lowe (1921), and Pessin and Burleigh (1941). Cook (1942, 1943 a and b) described several of the animals observed. Smith and List (1955) recorded a number of amphibians and reptiles which were collected on Horn Island. Since 1945 more attention has been paid to this subject. Kopman (1946) enlightened the public regarding the seasonal activity of the animals and changing conditions in the Mississippi Sound region in his delightful “Wild Acres,” a book of the Gulf Coast country. From 1940 on many scientists and students of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory visited Horn Island, but still comparatively little has been published. Rings and Richmond (1953) presented a brief survey on the mosquitoes collected by them during 1944 and 1945; the species listed by them, together with two additional ones, are included in this paper. The animals and plants actually collected or observed on Horn Island are listed in Part IV. Besides those collected by myself, species reported by other investigators are included.

UPDATE publications SET abstract="Because the early biologists did not see decapod larvae “in the act” of changing from one phase to another due to the fact that they were parts of planktonic collections and their parentage was unknown, each phase was given a generic and specific name of its own. Gurney (1921) did not concur with this practice, but was of the opinion that it is more profitable to assign larvae to definite genera or families, even if the reference proved to be wrong. The chief difficulty encountered in rearing decapod larvae is the maintenance of a constant supply of suitable living food (Needham, 1959). The early embryonic studies of brachyuran crustaceans did not reveal complete life histories. This was due primarily to the lack of effective culture techniques. Birge (1883) gave no details of his culture methods in the study of the development of Panopeus sayi (Smith). Hyman (1925) gave no account of an attempt to culture larvae of xanthid crabs. In recent years the use of definite diets for the larvae has resulted in a knowledge of complete life histories. Knudsen (1959) used Artemia nauplii in feeding larvae of four xanthid crabs of the California coast. Chamberlain (1961) used various combinations of Artemia nauplii and two species of algae to feed larvae of three xanthid crabs of the North Carolina coast. His best results were with a diet of Artemia alone. Former studies of brachyuran embryology at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory were confined to the description of larvae taken in planktonic collections at or near the surface. Advanced larval forms are not found in such collections. It seldom happens that in planktonic material a series of stages of the same larvae is taken which is sufficiently complete to enable the genus to be determined. The remainder must be identified as nearly as possible by reference to published descriptions of larvae whose parentage is known, and such identification must in many cases be very speculative. Hyman (1925) described a prezoeal, four zoeal and a megalops stage of Neopanope texana sayi (Smith) at Beaufort, North Carolina. Also in his studies is a description of a prezoeal and the first zoeal stage of Eurypanopeus depressus (Smith). Knudsen (1958, 1959, 1960) described culture methods and four zoeal stages and a megalops stage of four species of xanthid crabs from California. Prezoeae were described for two of these species.

A number of recent notes have shown, however, that present workers are largely unfamiliar with the rather extensive literature on fish teratology in respect to both particular anomalies and their previous recognition in a species or other taxon. There is an evident need for a compilation of the literature and it is hoped that the present work will fulfill its purpose by facilitating current and future studies in this important area of ichthyology. Standard bibliographical and abstracting sources such as Dean&#039;s , \"Bibliography of Fishes,\" \"Zoological Record,\" \"Biological Abstracts\" and the \"Current Bibliography for Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries\" have all been searched for applicable citations. Further entries have been obtained from Gemmill&#039;s \"Teratology of Fishes\" and other references available to the writer. It is unfortunate that the included references have not all been read and abstracted but this was beyond the scope of available time and finances. In general, the bibliography is restricted to naturally occurring anomalies and literature on the experimental production of abnormalities has been omitted. The few exceptions, particularly in the areas of wounds and regeneration, are included because of their obvious application to survival studies on free-living fishes. All citations are given equal status in that no attempt has been made to indicate relative importance of individual contributions. It is doubtful whether any bibliography may be considered complete but it is felt that literature dealing directly with abnormalities has been fairly well covered. The major omissions may be expected in papers of Russian, Baltic and Scandinavian origin as well as in references to teratological material included in studies of a more general nature, and not listed in the titles. In this respect, it is requested that errors of ommission and commission be brought to the writer&#039;s attention. Authors of pertinent subject material are requested to forward reprints so that a continuing file on anomalous fishes may be maintained at this Laboratory. Abbreviations and complete titles of literature sources have largely been compiled from the \"World List of Scientific Periodicals\" and the \"World List of Periodicals for Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries.\" The full title or place of publication have not been obtained for a few journals and these are identified only by the information available to the writer."

Samples were collected monthly from established locations for the chemical, biological and foraminiferal determinations. Results of the chemical and biological studies will be published by the respective investigators in subsequent papers.

The shrimp catch of the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts in 1360 amounted to one-fifth of the total value of all fishery products of the United States (Power, 1961), and the shrimp fishery is the most valuable one in the country. The catch depends almost wholly upon three species, Penaeus aztecus Ives, P. duorarum Burkenroad and P. setiferus (Linnaeus) , according to current usage. Up to about fifteen years ago the whole fishery depended upon the latter species, the North American white Because of their commercial importance, the penaeid shrimp are being studied increasingly in the Americas and other parts of the world. The literature, museum records and certain other information show that the name Penaeaeus setiferus has been misapplied for the past twenty-six years. The matter should be rectified now rather than later. The questions involved depend upon established rules of zoological nomenclature. The following account will be easily understood if it is remembered that there are two species of Atlantic American white shrimp. This fact was ascertained by Burkenroad (1936) and prior to that time all workers assumed that there was only one species, which was referred to uniformly as Pelzaelcs setiferus (Linnaeus).
